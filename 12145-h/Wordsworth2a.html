  To <b>Robert Southey, Esq., P.L., Etc., Etc.</b><br>
<br>
 <b> My Dear Friend</b>&mdash;The Tale of <i>Peter Bell</i>, which I now introduce
  to your notice, and to that of the Public, has, in its Manuscript
  state, nearly survived its <i>minority</i>:&mdash;for it first saw the
  light in the summer of 1798. During this long interval, pains have
  been taken at different times to make the production less unworthy of
  a favourable reception; or, rather, to fit it for filling
  <i>permanently</i> a station, however humble, in the Literature of our
  Country. This has, indeed, been the aim of all my endeavours in
  Poetry, which, you know, have been sufficiently laborious to prove
  that I deem the Art not lightly to be approached; and that the
  attainment of excellence in it, may laudably be made the principal
  object of intellectual pursuit by any man, who, with reasonable
  consideration of circumstances, has faith in his own impulses.<br>
<br>
  The Poem of <i>Peter Bell</i>, as the Prologue will show, was composed
  under a belief that the Imagination not only does not require for its
  exercise the intervention of supernatural agency, but that, though
  such agency be excluded, the faculty may be called forth as
  imperiously and for kindred results of pleasure, by incidents, within
  the compass of poetic probability, in the humblest departments of
  daily life. Since that Prologue was written, <i>you</i> have exhibited
  most splendid effects of judicious daring, in the opposite and usual
  course. Let this acknowledgment make my peace with the lovers of the
  supernatural; and I am persuaded it will be admitted, that to you, as
  a Master in that province of the art, the following Tale, whether from
  contrast or congruity, is not an unappropriate offering. Accept it,
  then, as a public testimony of affectionate admiration from one with
  whose name yours has been often coupled (to use your own words) for
  evil and for good; and believe me to be, with earnest wishes that life
  and health may be granted you to complete the many important works in
  which you are engaged, and with high respect, Most faithfully yours,<br>
<br>

<span style="color: #663300;">[Written at Alfoxden. Founded upon an anecdote which I read in a
newspaper, of an ass being found hanging his head over a canal in a
wretched posture. Upon examination a dead body was found in the water,
and proved to be the body of its master. The countenance, gait, and
figure of Peter were taken from a wild rover with whom I walked from
Builth, on the river Wye, downwards, nearly as far as the town of Hay.
He told me strange stories. It has always been a pleasure to me through
life, to catch at every opportunity that has occurred in my rambles of
becoming acquainted with this class of people. The number of Peter's
wives was taken from the trespasses, in this way, of a lawless creature,
who lived in the county of Durham, and used to be attended by many
women, sometimes not less than half a dozen, as disorderly as himself,
and a story went in the country that he had been heard to say, while
they were quarrelling, "Why can't ye be quiet, there's none so many of
you?" Benoni, or the child of sorrow, I knew when I was a schoolboy. His
mother had been deserted by a gentleman in the neighbourhood, she
herself being a gentlewoman by birth. The circumstances of her story
were told me by my dear old dame, Ann Tyson, who was her confidante. The
lady died broken-hearted. In the woods of Alfoxden I used to take great
delight in noticing the habits, tricks, and physiognomy of asses; and I
have no doubt that I was thus put upon writing the poem out of liking
for the creature that is often so dreadfully abused. The crescent moon,
which makes such a figure in the prologue, assumed this character one
evening while I was watching its beauty in front of Alfoxden House. I
intended this poem for the volume before spoken of, but it was not
published for more than twenty years afterwards. The worship of the
Methodists, or Ranters, is often heard during the stillness of the
summer evening, in the country, with affecting accompaniments of rural
beauty. In both the psalmody and voice of the preacher there is, not
unfrequently, much solemnity likely to impress the feelings of the
rudest characters under favourable circumstances.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>

<td>There's something in a flying horse,<br>
There's something in a huge balloon;<br>
But through the clouds I'll never float<br>
Until I have a little Boat,<br>
Shaped like the crescent-moon.<br><br>

And now I <i>have</i> a little Boat,<br>
In shape a very crescent-moon:<br>
Fast through the clouds my boat can sail;<br>
But if perchance your faith should fail,<br>
Look up&mdash;and you shall see me soon!<br><br>

The woods, my Friends, are round you roaring,<br>
Rocking and roaring like a sea;<br>
The noise of danger's in your ears,<br>
And ye have all a thousand fears<br>
Both for my little Boat and me!<br><br>

Meanwhile untroubled I admire<br>
The pointed horns of my canoe;<br>
And, did not pity touch my breast,<br>
To see how ye are all distrest,<br>
Till my ribs ached, I'd laugh at you!<br><br>

Away we go, my Boat and I&mdash;<br>
Frail man ne'er sate in such another;<br>
Whether among the winds we strive,<br>
Or deep into the clouds we dive,<br>
Each is contented with the other.<br><br>

Away we go&mdash;and what care we<br>
For treasons, tumults, and for wars?<br>
We are as calm in our delight<br>
As is the crescent-moon so bright<br>
Among the scattered stars.<br><br>

Up goes my Boat among the stars<br>
Through many a breathless field of light,<br>
Through many a long blue field of ether,<br>
Leaving ten thousand stars beneath her:<br>
Up goes my little Boat so bright!<br><br>

The Crab, the Scorpion, and the Bull&mdash;<br>
We pry among them all; have shot<br>
High o'er the red-haired race of Mars,<br>
Covered from top to toe with scars;<br>
Such company I like it not!<br><br>

The towns in Saturn are decayed,<br>
And melancholy Spectres throng them;&mdash;<br>
The Pleiads, that appear to kiss<br>
Each other in the vast abyss,<br>
With joy I sail among them,<br><br>

Swift Mercury resounds with mirth,<br>
Great Jove is full of stately bowers;<br>
But these, and all that they contain,<br>
What are they to that tiny grain,<br>
That little Earth of ours?<br><br>

Then back to Earth, the dear green Earth:&mdash;<br>
Whole ages if I here should roam,<br>
The world for my remarks and me<br>
Would not a whit the better be;<br>
I've left my heart at home.<br><br>

See! there she is, the matchless Earth!<br>
There spreads the famed Pacific Ocean!<br>
Old Andes thrusts yon craggy spear<br>
Through the grey clouds; the Alps are here,<br>
Like waters in commotion!<br><br>

Yon tawny slip is Libya's sands <br>
That silver thread the river Dnieper;<br>
And look, where clothed in brightest green<br>
Is a sweet Isle, of isles the Queen;<br>
Ye fairies, from all evil keep her! <br><br>

And see the town where I was born!<br>
Around those happy fields we span<br>
In boyish gambols;&mdash;I was lost<br>
Where I have been, but on this coast<br>
I feel I am a man. <br><br>

Never did fifty things at once<br>
Appear so lovely, never, never;&mdash;<br>
How tunefully the forests ring!<br>
To hear the earth's soft murmuring<br>
Thus could I hang for ever! <br><br>

"Shame on you!" cried my little Boat,<br>
"Was ever such a homesick Loon,<br>
Within a living Boat to sit,<br>
And make no better use of it;<br>
A Boat twin-sister of the crescent-moon! <br><br>

"Ne'er in the breast of full-grown Poet<br>
Fluttered so faint a heart before;&mdash;<br>
Was it the music of the spheres<br>
That overpowered your mortal ears?<br>
&mdash;Such din shall trouble them no more. <br><br>

"These nether precincts do not lack<br>
Charms of their own;&mdash;then come with me;<br>
I want a comrade, and for you<br>
There's nothing that I would not do;<br>
Nought is there that you shall not see. <br><br>

"Haste! and above Siberian snows<br>
We'll sport amid the boreal morning;<br>
Will mingle with her lustres gliding<br>
Among the stars, the stars now hiding,<br>
And now the stars adorning. <br><br>

"I know the secrets of a land<br>
Where human foot did never stray;<br>
Fair is that land as evening skies,<br>
And cool, though in the depth it lies<br>
Of burning Africa. <br><br>

"Or we'll into the realm of Faery,<br>
Among the lovely shades of things;<br>
The shadowy forms of mountains bare,<br>
And streams, and bowers, and ladies fair,<br>
The shades of palaces and kings! <br><br>

"Or, if you thirst with hardy zeal<br>
Less quiet regions to explore,<br>
Prompt voyage shall to you reveal<br>
How earth and heaven are taught to feel<br>
The might of magic lore!"<br>
 <br>
"My little vagrant Form of light,<br>
My gay and beautiful Canoe,<br>
Well have you played your friendly part;<br>
As kindly take what from my heart<br>
Experience forces&mdash;then adieu! <br><br>

"Temptation lurks among your words;<br>
But, while these pleasures you're pursuing<br>
Without impediment or let,<br>
No wonder if you quite forget<br>
What on the earth is doing.<br><br>

"There was a time when all mankind<br>
Did listen with a faith sincere<br>
To tuneful tongues in mystery versed;<br>
<i>Then</i> Poets fearlessly rehearsed<br>
The wonders of a wild career.<br><br>

"Go&mdash;(but the world's a sleepy world,<br>
And 'tis, I fear, an age too late)<br>
Take with you some ambitious Youth!<br>
For, restless Wanderer! I, in truth,<br>
Am all unfit to be your mate.<br><br>

"Long have I loved what I behold,<br>
The night that calms, the day that cheers;<br>
The common growth of mother-earth<br>
Suffices me&mdash;her tears, her mirth,<br>
Her humblest mirth and tears.<br><br>

"The dragon's wing, the magic ring,<br>
I shall not covet for my dower,<br>
If I along that lowly way<br>
With sympathetic heart may stray,<br>
And with a soul of power.<br><br>

"These given, what more need I desire<br>
To stir, to soothe, or elevate?<br>
What nobler marvels than the mind<br>
May in life's daily prospect find,<br>
May find or there create?<br><br>

"A potent wand doth Sorrow wield;<br>
What spell so strong as guilty Fear!<br>
Repentance is a tender Sprite;<br>
If aught on earth have heavenly might,<br>
'Tis lodged within her silent tear.<br><br>

"But grant my wishes,&mdash;let us now<br>
Descend from this ethereal height;<br>
Then take thy way, adventurous Skiff,<br>
More daring far than Hippogriff,<br>
And be thy own delight!<br><br>

"To the stone-table in my garden,<br>
Loved haunt of many a summer hour,<br>
The Squire is come: his daughter Bess<br>
Beside him in the cool recess<br>
Sits blooming like a flower.<br><br>

"With these are many more convened;<br>
They know not I have been so far;&mdash;<br>
I see them there, in number nine,<br>
Beneath the spreading Weymouth-pine!<br>
I see them&mdash;there they are!<br><br>

"There sits the Vicar and his Dame;<br>
And there my good friend, Stephen Otter;<br>
And, ere the light of evening fail,<br>
To them I must relate the Tale<br>
Of Peter Bell the Potter."<br><br>

Off flew the Boat&mdash;away she flees,<br>
Spurning her freight with indignation!<br>
"And I, as well as I was able,<br>
On two poor legs, toward my stone-table<br>
Limped on with sore vexation.<br><br>

"O, here he is!" cried little Bess&mdash;<br>
She saw me at the garden-door;<br>
"We've waited anxiously and long,"<br>
They cried, and all around me throng,<br>
Full nine of them or more! <br><br>

"Reproach me not&mdash;your fears be still&mdash;<br>
Be thankful we again have met;&mdash;<br>
Resume, my Friends! within the shade<br>
Your seats, and quickly shall be paid<br>
The well-remembered debt."<br><br>

I spake with faltering voice, like one<br>
Not wholly rescued from the pale<br>
Of a wild dream, or worse illusion;<br>
But, straight, to cover my confusion,<br>
Began the promised Tale.</td>

<td>All by the moonlight river side<br>
Groaned the poor Beast&mdash;alas! in vain;<br>
The staff was raised to loftier height,<br>
And the blows fell with heavier weight<br>
As Peter struck&mdash;and struck again.<br>
<br>
"Hold!" cried the Squire, "against the rules<br>
Of common sense you're surely sinning;<br>
This leap is for us all too bold;<br>
Who Peter was, let that be told,<br>
And start from the beginning."<br><br>

&mdash;"A Potter, Sir, he was by trade,"<br>
Said I, becoming quite collected;<br>
"And wheresoever he appeared,<br>
Full twenty times was Peter feared<br>
For once that Peter was respected.<br><br>

"He two-and-thirty years or more,<br>
Had been a wild and woodland rover;<br>
Had heard the Atlantic surges roar<br>
On farthest Cornwall's rocky shore,<br>
And trod the cliffs of Dover.<br><br>

"And he had seen Caernarvon's towers,<br>
And well he knew the spire of Sarum;<br>
And he had been where Lincoln bell<br>
Flings o'er the fen that ponderous knell&mdash;<br>
A far-renowned alarum.<br><br>

"At Doncaster, at York, and Leeds,<br>
And merry Carlisle had he been;<br>
And all along the Lowlands fair,<br>
All through the bonny shire of Ayr;<br>
And far as Aberdeen.<br><br>

"And he had been at Inverness;<br>
And Peter, by the mountain-rills,<br>
Had danced his round with Highland lasses;<br>
And he had lain beside his asses<br>
On lofty Cheviot Hills:<br><br>

"And he had trudged through Yorkshire dales,<br>
Among the rocks and winding <i>scars</i>;<br>
Where deep and low the hamlets lie<br>
Beneath their little patch of sky<br>
And little lot of stars:<br><br>

"And all along the indented coast,<br>
Bespattered with the salt-sea foam;<br>
Where'er a knot of houses lay<br>
On headland, or in hollow bay;&mdash;<br>
Sure never man like him did roam!<br><br>

"As well might Peter, in the Fleet,<br>
Have been fast bound, a begging debtor;&mdash;<br>
He travelled here, he travelled there;&mdash;<br>
But not the value of a hair<br>
Was heart or head the better.<br><br>

"He roved among the vales and streams,<br>
In the green wood and hollow dell;<br>
They were his dwellings night and day,&mdash;<br>
But nature ne'er could find the way<br>
Into the heart of Peter Bell.<br><br>

"In vain, through every changeful year,<br>
Did Nature lead him as before;<br>
A primrose by a river's brim<br>
A yellow primrose was to him,<br>
And it was nothing more.<br><br>

"Small change it made in Peter's heart<br>
To see his gentle panniered train<br>
With more than vernal pleasure feeding,<br>
Where'er the tender grass was leading<br>
Its earliest green along the lane.<br><br>

"In vain, through water, earth, and air,<br>
The soul of happy sound was spread,<br>
When Peter on some April morn,<br>
Beneath the broom or budding thorn,<br>
Made the warm earth his lazy bed.<br><br>

"At noon, when, by the forest's edge<br>
He lay beneath the branches high,<br>
The soft blue sky did never melt<br>
Into his heart; he never felt<br>
The witchery of the soft blue sky!<br><br>

"On a fair prospect some have looked<br>
And felt, as I have heard them say,<br>
As if the moving time had been<br>
A thing as steadfast as the scene<br>
On which they gazed themselves away.<br><br>

"Within the breast of Peter Bell<br>
These silent raptures found no place;<br>
He was a Carl as wild and rude<br>
As ever hue-and-cry pursued,<br>
As ever ran a felon's race.<br><br>

"Of all that lead a lawless life,<br>
Of all that love their lawless lives,<br>
In city or in village small,<br>
He was the wildest far of all;&mdash;<br>
He had a dozen wedded wives.<br><br>

"Nay, start not!&mdash;wedded wives&mdash;and twelve!<br>
But how one wife could e'er come near him,<br>
In simple truth I cannot tell;<br>
For, be it said of Peter Bell,<br>
To see him was to fear him.<br><br>

"Though Nature could not touch his heart<br>
By lovely forms, and silent weather,<br>
And tender sounds, yet you might see<br>
At once, that Peter Bell and she <br>
Had often been together. <br><br>

"A savage wildness round him hung<br>
As of a dweller out of doors;<br>
In his whole figure and his mien<br>
A savage character was seen<br>
Of mountains and of dreary moors.<br><br>

"To all the unshaped half-human thoughts<br>
Which solitary Nature feeds<br>
'Mid summer storms or winter's ice,<br>
Had Peter joined whatever vice<br>
The cruel city breeds.<br><br>

"His face was keen as is the wind<br>
That cuts along the hawthorn-fence;<br>
Of courage you saw little there,<br>
But, in its stead, a medley air<br>
Of cunning and of impudence.<br><br>

"He had a dark and sidelong walk,<br>
And long and slouching was his gait;<br>
Beneath his looks so bare and bold,<br>
You might perceive, his spirit cold<br>
Was playing with some inward bait.<br><br>

"His forehead wrinkled was and furred;<br>
A work, one half of which was done <br>
By thinking of his '<i>whens</i>,' and '<i>hows</i>';<br>
And half, by knitting of his brows<br>
Beneath the glaring sun.<br><br>

"There was a hardness in his cheek,<br>
There was a hardness in his eye,<br>
As if the man had fixed his face,<br>
In many a solitary place,<br>
Against the wind and open sky!"<br><br>

 &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br><br>

One night, (and now my little Bess!<br>
We've reached at last the promised Tale;)<br>
One beautiful November night,<br>
When the full moon was shining bright<br>
Upon the rapid river Swale,<br><br>

Along the river's winding banks<br>
Peter was travelling all alone;<br>
Whether to buy or sell, or led<br>
By pleasure running in his head,<br>
To me was never known.<br> <br>

He trudged along through copse and brake,<br>
He trudged along o'er hill and dale;<br>
Nor for the moon cared he a tittle,<br>
And for the stars he cared as little,<br>
And for the murmuring river Swale.<br><br>

But, chancing to espy a path<br>
That promised to cut short the way;<br>
As many a wiser man hath done,<br>
He left a trusty guide for one<br>
That might his steps betray.<br><br>

To a thick wood he soon is brought<br>
Where cheerily his course he weaves,<br>
And whistling loud may yet be heard,<br>
Though often buried, like a bird<br>
Darkling, among the boughs and leaves.<br><br>

But quickly Peter's mood is changed,<br>
And on he drives with cheeks that burn<br>
In downright fury and in wrath;&mdash;<br>
There's little sign the treacherous path<br>
Will to the road return!<br><br>

The path grows dim, and dimmer still;<br>
Now up, now down, the Rover wends,<br>
With all the sail that he can carry,<br>
Till brought to a deserted quarry&mdash; <br>
And there the pathway ends.<br>
<br>
He paused&mdash;for shadows of strange shape,<br>
Massy and black, before him lay;<br>
But through the dark, and through the cold,<br>
And through the yawning fissures old,<br>
Did Peter boldly press his way<br><br>

Right through the quarry;&mdash;and behold<br>
A scene of soft and lovely hue!<br>
Where blue and grey, and tender green,<br>
Together make as sweet a scene<br>
As ever human eye did view.<br><br>

Beneath the clear blue sky he saw<br>
A little field of meadow ground;<br>
But field or meadow name it not;<br>
Call it of earth a small green plot,<br>
With rocks encompassed round.<br><br>

The Swale flowed under the grey rocks,<br>
But he flowed quiet and unseen;&mdash;<br>
You need a strong and stormy gale<br>
To bring the noises of the Swale<br>
To that green spot, so calm and green!<br>
<br>
And is there no one dwelling here,<br>
No hermit with his beads and glass?<br>
And does no little cottage look<br>
Upon this soft and fertile nook?<br>
Does no one live near this green grass?<br><br>

Across the deep and quiet spot<br>
Is Peter driving through the grass&mdash;<br>
And now has reached the skirting trees;<br>
When, turning round his head, he sees<br>
A solitary Ass.<br>
<br>
"A prize!" cries Peter&mdash;but he first<br>
Must spy about him far and near:<br>
There's not a single house in sight,<br>
No woodman's hut, no cottage light&mdash;<br>
Peter, you need not fear!<br><br>

There's nothing to be seen but woods,<br>
And rocks that spread a hoary gleam,<br>
And this one Beast, that from the bed<br>
Of the green meadow hangs his head<br>
Over the silent stream.<br><br>

His head is with a halter bound;<br>
The halter seizing, Peter leapt<br>
Upon the Creature's back, and plied<br>
With ready heels his shaggy side;<br>
But still the Ass his station kept.<br>
<br>
Then Peter gave a sudden jerk,<br>
A jerk that from a dungeon-floor<br>
Would have pulled up an iron ring;<br>
But still the heavy-headed Thing<br>
Stood just as he had stood before!<br><br>

Quoth Peter, leaping from his seat,<br>
"There is some plot against me laid";<br>
Once more the little meadow-ground<br>
And all the hoary cliffs around<br>
He cautiously surveyed.<br><br>

All, all is silent&mdash;rocks and woods,<br>
All still and silent&mdash;far and near!<br>
Only the Ass, with motion dull,<br>
Upon the pivot of his skull<br>
Turns round his long left ear.<br><br>

Thought Peter, What can mean all this?<br>
Some ugly witchcraft must be here!<br>
&mdash;Once more the Ass, with motion dull,<br>
Upon the pivot of his skull<br>
Turned round his long left ear.<br><br>

Suspicion ripened into dread;<br>
Yet with deliberate action slow,<br>
His staff high-raising, in the pride<br>
Of skill, upon the sounding hide,<br>
He dealt a sturdy blow.<br><br>

The poor Ass staggered with the shock;<br>
And then, as if to take his ease,<br>
In quiet uncomplaining mood,<br>
Upon the spot where he had stood,<br>
Dropped gently down upon his knees;<br><br>

As gently on his side he fell;<br>
And by the river's brink did lie;<br>
And, while he lay like one that mourned,<br>
The patient Beast on Peter turned<br>
His shining hazel eye.<br><br>

'Twas but one mild, reproachful look,<br>
A look more tender than severe;<br>
And straight in sorrow, not in dread,<br>
He turned the eye-ball in his head<br>
Towards the smooth river deep and clear.<br><br>

Upon the Beast the sapling rings;<br>
His lank sides heaved, his limbs they stirred;<br>
He gave a groan, and then another,<br>
Of that which went before the brother,<br>
And then he gave a third.<br><br>

All by the moonlight river side<br>
He gave three miserable groans;<br>
And not till now hath Peter seen<br>
How gaunt the Creature is,&mdash;how lean<br>
And sharp his staring bones!<br><br>

With legs stretched out and stiff he lay:&mdash;<br>
No word of kind commiseration<br>
Fell at the sight from Peter's tongue;<br>
With hard contempt his heart was wrung,<br>
With hatred and vexation.<br><br>

The meagre beast lay still as death;<br>
And Peter's lips with fury quiver;<br>
Quoth he, "You little mulish dog,<br>
I'll fling your carcass like a log<br>
Head-foremost down the river!"<br><br>

An impious oath confirmed the threat&mdash;<br>
Whereat from the earth on which he lay<br>
To all the echoes, south and north,<br>
And east and west, the Ass sent forth<br>
A long and clamorous bray!<br><br>

This outcry, on the heart of Peter,<br>
Seems like a note of joy to strike,&mdash;<br>
Joy at the heart of Peter knocks;<br>
But in the echo of the rocks<br>
Was something Peter did not like.<br><br>

Whether to cheer his coward breast,<br>
Or that he could not break the chain,<br>
In this serene and solemn hour,<br>
Twined round him by demoniac power,<br>
To the blind work he turned again.<br><br>

Among the rocks and winding crags;<br>
Among the mountains far away;<br>
Once more the Ass did lengthen out<br>
More ruefully a deep-drawn shout,<br>
The hard dry see-saw of his horrible bray!<br><br>

What is there now in Peter's heart!<br>
Or whence the might of this strange sound?<br>
The moon uneasy looked and dimmer,<br>
The broad blue heavens appeared to glimmer,<br>
And the rocks staggered all around&mdash;<br><br>

From Peter's hand the sapling dropped!<br>
Threat has he none to execute;<br>
"If any one should come and see<br>
That I am here, they'll think," quoth he,<br>
"I'm helping this poor dying brute."<br><br>

He scans the Ass from limb to limb,<br>
And ventures now to uplift his eyes;<br>
More steady looks the moon, and clear,<br>
More like themselves the rocks appear<br>
And touch more quiet skies.<br><br>

His scorn returns&mdash;his hate revives;<br>
He stoops the Ass's neck to seize<br>
With malice&mdash;that again takes flight;<br>
For in the pool a startling sight<br>
Meets him, among the inverted trees.<br><br>

Is it the moon's distorted face?<br>
The ghost-like image of a cloud?<br>
Is it a gallows there portrayed?<br>
Is Peter of himself afraid?<br>
Is it a coffin,&mdash;or a shroud?<br><br>

A grisly idol hewn in stone?<br>
Or imp from witch's lap let fall?<br>
Perhaps a ring of shining fairies?<br>
Such as pursue their feared vagaries<br>
In sylvan bower, or haunted hall?<br><br>

Is it a fiend that to a stake<br>
Of fire his desperate self is tethering?<br>
Or stubborn spirit doomed to yell<br>
In solitary ward or cell,<br>
Ten thousand miles from all his brethren?<br>
<br>
Never did pulse so quickly throb,<br>
And never heart so loudly panted;<br>
He looks, he cannot choose but look;<br>
Like some one reading in a book&mdash;<br>
A book that is enchanted.<br><br>

Ah, well-a-day for Peter Bell!<br>
He will be turned to iron soon,<br>
Meet Statue for the court of Fear!<br>
His hat is up&mdash;and every hair<br>
Bristles, and whitens in the moon!<br><br>

He looks, he ponders, looks again;<br>
He sees a motion&mdash;hears a groan;<br>
His eyes will burst&mdash;his heart will break&mdash;<br>
He gives a loud and frightful shriek,<br>
And back he falls, as if his life were flown!</td>

<td>We left our Hero in a trance,<br>
Beneath the alders, near the river;<br>
The Ass is by the river-side,<br>
And, where the feeble breezes glide,<br>
Upon the stream the moonbeams quiver.<br><br>

A happy respite! but at length<br>
He feels the glimmering of the moon;<br>
Wakes with glazed eye, and feebly sighing&mdash;<br>
To sink, perhaps, where he is lying,<br>
Into a second swoon!<br><br>

He lifts his head, he sees his staff;<br>
He touches&mdash;'tis to him a treasure!<br>
Faint recollection seems to tell<br>
That he is yet where mortals dwell&mdash;<br>
A thought received with languid pleasure!<br><br>

His head upon his elbow propped,<br>
Becoming less and less perplexed,<br>
Sky-ward he looks&mdash;to rock and wood&mdash;<br>
And then&mdash;upon the glassy flood<br>
His wandering eye is fixed.<br><br>

Thought he, that is the face of one<br>
In his last sleep securely bound!<br>
So toward the stream his head he bent,<br>
And downward thrust his staff, intent<br>
The river's depth to sound.<br><br>

<i>Now</i>&mdash;like a tempest-shattered bark,<br>
That overwhelmed and prostrate lies,<br>
And in a moment to the verge<br>
Is lifted of a foaming surge&mdash;<br>
Full suddenly the Ass doth rise!<br><br>

His staring bones all shake with joy,<br>
And close by Peter's side he stands:<br>
While Peter o'er the river bends,<br>
The little Ass his neck extends,<br>
And fondly licks his hands.<br><br>

Such life is in the Ass's eyes,<br>
Such life is in his limbs and ears;<br>
That Peter Bell, if he had been<br>
The veriest coward ever seen,<br>
Must now have thrown aside his fears.<br><br>

The Ass looks on&mdash;and to his work<br>
Is Peter quietly resigned;<br>
He touches here&mdash;he touches there&mdash;<br>
And now among the dead man's hair<br>
His sapling Peter has entwined.<br><br>

He pulls&mdash;and looks&mdash;and pulls again;<br>
And he whom the poor Ass had lost,<br>
The man who had been four days dead,<br>
Head-foremost from the river's bed<br>
Uprises like a ghost!<br><br>

And Peter draws him to dry land;<br>
And through the brain of Peter pass<br>
Some poignant twitches, fast and faster;<br>
"No doubt," quoth he, "he is the Master<br>
Of this poor miserable Ass!"<br><br>

The meagre shadow that looks on&mdash;<br>
What would he now? what is he doing?<br>
His sudden fit of joy is flown,&mdash;<br>
He on his knees hath laid him down,<br>
As if he were his grief renewing;<br><br>

But no&mdash;that Peter on his back<br>
Must mount, he shows well as he can:<br>
Thought Peter then, come weal or woe<br>
I'll do what he would have me do,<br>
In pity to this poor drowned man.<br><br>

With that resolve he boldly mounts<br>
Upon the pleased and thankful Ass;<br>
And then, without a moment's stay,<br>
That earnest Creature turned away,<br>
Leaving the body on the grass.<br><br>

Intent upon his faithful watch,<br>
The Beast four days and nights had past;<br>
A sweeter meadow ne'er was seen,<br>
And there the Ass four days had been,<br>
Nor ever once did break his fast:<br><br>

Yet firm his step, and stout his heart;<br>
The mead is crossed&mdash;the quarry's mouth<br>
Is reached; but there the trusty guide<br>
Into a thicket turns aside,<br>
And deftly ambles towards the south.<br><br>

When hark a burst of doleful sound!<br>
And Peter honestly might say,<br>
The like came never to his ears,<br>
Though he has been, full thirty years,<br>
A rover&mdash;night and day!<br><br>

'Tis not a plover of the moors,<br>
'Tis not a bittern of the fen;<br>
Nor can it be a barking fox,<br>
Nor night-bird chambered in the rocks,<br>
Nor wild-cat in a woody glen!<br><br>

The Ass is startled&mdash;and stops short<br>
Right in the middle of the thicket;<br>
And Peter, wont to whistle loud<br>
Whether alone or in a crowd,<br>
Is silent as a silent cricket.<br><br>

What ails you now, my little Bess?<br>
Well may you tremble and look grave!<br>
This cry&mdash;that rings along the wood,<br>
This cry&mdash;that floats adown the flood,<br>
Comes from the entrance of a cave:<br><br>

I see a blooming Wood-boy there,<br>
And if I had the power to say<br>
How sorrowful the wanderer is,<br>
Your heart would be as sad as his<br>
Till you had kissed his tears away!<br><br>

Grasping a hawthorn branch in hand,<br>
All bright with berries ripe and red,<br>
Into the cavern's mouth he peeps;<br>
Thence back into the moonlight creeps;<br>
Whom seeks he&mdash;whom?&mdash;the silent dead:<br><br>

His father!&mdash;Him doth he require&mdash;<br>
Him hath he sought with fruitless pains,<br>
Among the rocks, behind the trees;<br>
Now creeping on his hands and knees,<br>
Now running o'er the open plains.<br><br>

And hither is he come at last,<br>
When he through such a day has gone,<br>
By this dark cave to be distrest<br>
Like a poor bird&mdash;her plundered nest<br>
Hovering around with dolorous moan!<br><br>

Of that intense and piercing cry<br>
The listening Ass conjectures well;<br>
Wild as it is, he there can read<br>
Some intermingled notes that plead<br>
With touches irresistible.<br><br>

But Peter&mdash;when he saw the Ass<br>
Not only stop but turn, and change<br>
The cherished tenor of his pace<br>
That lamentable cry to chase&mdash;<br>
It wrought in him conviction strange;<br><br>

A faith that, for the dead man's sake<br>
And this poor slave who loved him well,<br>
Vengeance upon his head will fall,<br>
Some visitation worse than all<br>
Which ever till this night befel.<br><br>

Meanwhile the Ass to reach his home,<br>
Is striving stoutly as he may;<br>
But, while he climbs the woody hill,<br>
The cry grows weak&mdash;and weaker still;<br>
And now at last it dies away.<br><br>

So with his freight the Creature turns<br>
Into a gloomy grove of beech,<br>
Along the shade with footsteps true<br>
Descending slowly, till the two<br>
The open moonlight reach.<br><br>

And there, along the narrow dell,<br>
A fair smooth pathway you discern,<br>
A length of green and open road&mdash;<br>
As if it from a fountain flowed&mdash;<br>
Winding away between the fern.<br><br>

The rocks that tower on either side<br>
Build up a wild fantastic scene;<br>
Temples like those among the Hindoos,<br>
And mosques, and spires, and abbey-windows,<br>
And castles all with ivy green!<br><br>

And, while the Ass pursues his way,<br>
Along this solitary dell,<br>
As pensively his steps advance,<br>
The mosques and spires change countenance,<br>
And look at Peter Bell!<br><br>

That unintelligible cry<br>
Hath left him high in preparation,&mdash;<br>
Convinced that he, or soon or late,<br>
This very night will meet his fate&mdash;<br>
And so he sits in expectation!<br>
<br>
The strenuous Animal hath clomb<br>
With the green path; and now he wends<br>
Where, shining like the smoothest sea,<br>
In undisturbed immensity<br>
A level plain extends.<br><br>

But whence this faintly-rustling sound<br>
By which the journeying pair are chased?<br>
&mdash;A withered leaf is close behind,<br>
Light plaything for the sportive wind<br>
Upon that solitary waste.<br><br>

When Peter spied the moving thing,<br>
It only doubled his distress;<br>
"Where there is not a bush or tree,<br>
The very leaves they follow me&mdash;<br>
So huge hath been my wickedness!"<br><br>

To a close lane they now are come,<br>
Where, as before, the enduring Ass<br>
Moves on without a moment's stop,<br>
Nor once turns round his head to crop<br>
A bramble-leaf or blade of grass.<br><br>

Between the hedges as they go,<br>
The white dust sleeps upon the lane;<br>
And Peter, ever and anon<br>
Back-looking, sees, upon a stone,<br>
Or in the dust, a crimson stain.<br><br>

A stain&mdash;as of a drop of blood<br>
By moonlight made more faint and wan;<br>
Ha! why these sinkings of despair?<br>
He knows not how the blood comes there&mdash;<br>
And Peter is a wicked man.<br><br>

At length he spies a bleeding wound,<br>
Where he had struck the Ass's head;<br>
He sees the blood, knows what it is,&mdash;<br>
A glimpse of sudden joy was his,<br>
But then it quickly fled;<br><br>

Of him whom sudden death had seized<br>
He thought,&mdash;of thee, O faithful Ass!<br>
And once again those ghastly pains,<br>
Shoot to and fro through heart and reins,<br>
And through his brain like lightning pass.</td>

<td>I've heard of one, a gentle Soul,<br>
Though given to sadness and to gloom, <br>
And for the fact will vouch,&mdash;one night<br>
It chanced that by a taper's light<br>
This man was reading in his room;<br><br>

Bending, as you or I might bend<br>
At night o'er any pious book,<br>
When sudden blackness overspread<br>
The snow-white page on which he read,<br>
And made the good man round him look.<br><br>

The chamber walls were dark all round,&mdash;<br>
And to his book he turned again;<br>
&mdash;The light had left the lonely taper,<br>
And formed itself upon the paper<br>
Into large letters&mdash;bright and plain!<br><br>

The godly book was in his hand&mdash;<br>
And, on the page, more black than coal,<br>
Appeared, set forth in strange array,<br>
A <i>word</i>&mdash;which to his dying day<br>
Perplexed the good man's gentle soul.<br><br>

The ghostly word, thus plainly seen,<br>
Did never from his lips depart;<br>
But he hath said, poor gentle wight!<br>
It brought full many a sin to light<br>
Out of the bottom of his heart.<br><br>

Dread Spirits! to confound the meek<br>
Why wander from your course so far,<br>
Disordering colour, form, and stature!<br>
&mdash;Let good men feel the soul of nature,<br>
And see things as they are.<br><br>

Yet, potent Spirits! well I know,<br>
How ye, that play with soul and sense,<br>
Are not unused to trouble friends<br>
Of goodness, for most gracious ends&mdash;<br>
And this I speak in reverence!<br><br>

But might I give advice to you,<br>
Whom in my fear I love so well;<br>
From men of pensive virtue go,<br>
Dread Beings! and your empire show<br>
On hearts like that of Peter Bell.<br><br>

Your presence often have I felt<br>
In darkness and the stormy night;<br>
And, with like force, if need there be,<br>
Ye can put forth your agency<br>
When earth is calm, and heaven is bright.<br><br>

Then, coming from the wayward world,<br>
That powerful world in which ye dwell,<br>
Come, Spirits of the Mind! and try,<br>
To-night, beneath the moonlight sky,<br>
What may be done with Peter Bell!<br><br>

&mdash;O, would that some more skilful voice<br>
My further labour might prevent!<br>
Kind Listeners, that around me sit,<br>
I feel that I am all unfit<br>
For such high argument.<br><br>

I've played, I've danced, with my narration;<br>
I loitered long ere I began:<br>
Ye waited then on my good pleasure;<br>
Pour out indulgence still, in measure<br>
As liberal as ye can!<br><br>

Our Travellers, ye remember well,<br>
Are thridding a sequestered lane;<br>
And Peter many tricks is trying,<br>
And many anodynes applying,<br>
To ease his conscience of its pain.<br><br>

By this his heart is lighter far;<br>
And, finding that he can account<br>
So snugly for that crimson stain,<br>
His evil spirit up again<br>
Does like an empty bucket mount.<br><br>

And Peter is a deep logician<br>
Who hath no lack of wit mercurial;<br>
"Blood drops&mdash;leaves rustle&mdash;yet," quoth he,<br>
"This poor man never, but for me,<br>
Could have had Christian burial.<br><br>

"And, say the best you can, 'tis plain,<br>
That here has been some wicked dealing;<br>
No doubt the devil in me wrought;<br>
I'm not the man who could have thought<br>
An Ass like this was worth the stealing!"<br><br>

So from his pocket Peter takes<br>
His shining horn tobacco-box;<br>
And, in a light and careless way,<br>
As men who with their purpose play,<br>
Upon the lid he knocks.<br><br>

Let them whose voice can stop the clouds,<br>
Whose cunning eye can see the wind,<br>
Tell to a curious world the cause<br>
Why, making here a sudden pause,<br>
The Ass turned round his head, and <i>grinned.</i><br><br>

Appalling process! I have marked<br>
The like on heath, in lonely wood;<br>
And, verily, have seldom met<br>
A spectacle more hideous&mdash;yet<br>
It suited Peter's present mood.<br><br>

And, grinning in his turn, his teeth<br>
He in jocose defiance showed&mdash;<br>
When, to upset his spiteful mirth,<br>
A murmur, pent within the earth,<br>
In the dead earth beneath the road,<br><br>

Rolled audibly! it swept along,<br>
A muffled noise&mdash;a rumbling sound!&mdash;<br>
'Twas by a troop of miners made,<br>
Plying with gunpowder their trade,<br>
Some twenty fathoms underground.<br><br>

Small cause of dire effect! for, surely,<br>
If ever mortal, King or Cotter,<br>
Believed that earth was charged to quake<br>
And yawn for his unworthy sake,<br>
'Twas Peter Bell the Potter.<br><br>

But, as an oak in breathless air<br>
Will stand though to the centre hewn;<br>
Or as the weakest things, if frost<br>
Have stiffened them, maintain their post;<br>
So he, beneath the gazing moon!&mdash;<br><br>

The Beast bestriding thus, he reached<br>
A spot where, in a sheltering cove,<br>
A little chapel stands alone,<br>
With greenest ivy overgrown,<br>
And tufted with an ivy grove;<br><br>

Dying insensibly away<br>
From human thoughts and purposes,<br>
It seemed&mdash;wall, window, roof and tower&mdash;<br>
To bow to some transforming power,<br>
And blend with the surrounding trees.<br><br>

As ruinous a place it was,<br>
Thought Peter, in the shire of Fife<br>
That served my turn, when following still<br>
From land to land a reckless will<br>
I married my sixth wife!<br><br>

The unheeding Ass moves slowly on,<br>
And now is passing by an inn<br>
Brim-full of a carousing crew,<br>
That make, with curses not a few,<br>
An uproar and a drunken din.<br><br>

I cannot well express the thoughts<br>
Which Peter in those noises found;&mdash;<br>
A stifling power compressed his frame,<br>
While-as a swimming darkness came<br>
Over that dull and dreary sound.<br><br>

For well did Peter know the sound;<br>
The language of those drunken joys<br>
To him, a jovial soul, I ween,<br>
But a few hours ago, had been<br>
A gladsome and a welcome noise.<br><br>

<i>Now</i>, turned adrift into the past,<br>
He finds no solace in his course;<br>
Like planet-stricken men of yore,<br>
He trembles, smitten to the core<br>
By strong compunction and remorse.<br><br>

But, more than all, his heart is stung<br>
To think of one, almost a child;<br>
A sweet and playful Highland girl,<br>
As light and beauteous as a squirrel,<br>
As beauteous and as wild!<br><br>

Her dwelling was a lonely house,<br>
A cottage in a heathy dell;<br>
And she put on her gown of green,<br>
And left her mother at sixteen,<br>
And followed Peter Bell.<br><br>

But many good and pious thoughts<br>
Had she; and, in the kirk to pray,<br>
Two long Scotch miles, through rain or snow,<br>
To kirk she had been used to go,<br>
Twice every Sabbath-day.<br><br>

And, when she followed Peter Bell,<br>
It was to lead an honest life;<br>
For he, with tongue not used to falter,<br>
Had pledged his troth before the altar<br>
To love her as his wedded wife.<br><br>

A mother's hope is hers;&mdash;but soon<br>
She drooped and pined like one forlorn;<br>
From Scripture she a name did borrow;<br>
Benoni, or the child of sorrow,<br>
She called her babe unborn.<br><br>

For she had learned how Peter lived,<br>
And took it in most grievous part;<br>
She to the very bone was worn,<br>
And, ere that little child was born,<br>
Died of a broken heart.<br><br>

And now the Spirits of the Mind<br>
Are busy with poor Peter Bell;<br>
Upon the rights of visual sense<br>
Usurping, with a prevalence<br>
More terrible than magic spell.<br><br>

Close by a brake of flowering furze<br>
(Above it shivering aspens play)<br>
He sees an unsubstantial creature,<br>
His very self in form and feature,<br>
Not four yards from the broad highway:<br><br>

And stretched beneath the furze he sees<br>
The Highland girl&mdash;it is no other;<br>
And hears her crying as she cried,<br>
The very moment that she died,<br>
"My mother! oh my mother!"<br><br>

The sweat pours down from Peter's face,<br>
So grievous is his heart's contrition;<br>
With agony his eye-balls ache<br>
While he beholds by the furze-brake<br>
This miserable vision!<br><br>

Calm is the well-deserving brute,<br>
<i>His</i> peace hath no offence betrayed;<br>
But now, while down that slope he wends,<br>
A voice to Peter's ear ascends,<br>
Resounding from the woody glade:<br><br>

The voice, though clamorous as a horn<br>
Re-echoed by a naked rock,<br>
Comes from that tabernacle&mdash;List!<br>
Within, a fervent Methodist<br>
Is preaching to no heedless flock!<br><br>

"Repent! repent!" he cries aloud,<br>
"While yet ye may find mercy;&mdash;strive<br>
To love the Lord with all your might;<br>
Turn to him, seek him day and night,<br>
And save your souls alive!<br><br>

"Repent! repent! though ye have gone,<br>
Through paths of wickedness and woe,<br>
After the Babylonian harlot;<br>
And, though your sins be red as scarlet,<br>
They shall be white as snow!"<br><br>

Even as he passed the door, these words<br>
Did plainly come to Peter's ears;<br>
And they such joyful tidings were,<br>
The joy was more than he could bear!&mdash;<br>
He melted into tears.<br><br>

Sweet tears of hope and tenderness!<br>
And fast they fell, a plenteous shower!<br>
His nerves, his sinews seemed to melt;<br>
Through all his iron frame was felt<br>
A gentle, a relaxing, power!<br><br>

Each fibre of his frame was weak;<br>
Weak all the animal within;<br>
But, in its helplessness, grew mild<br>
And gentle as an infant child,<br>
An infant that has known no sin.<br><br>

'Tis said, meek Beast! that, through Heaven's grace,<br>
He not unmoved did notice now<br>
The cross upon thy shoulder scored,<br>
For lasting impress, by the Lord<br>
To whom all human-kind shall bow;<br><br>

Memorial of his touch&mdash;that day<br>
When Jesus humbly deigned to ride,<br>
Entering the proud Jerusalem,<br>
By an immeasurable stream<br>
Of shouting people deified!<br><br>

Meanwhile the persevering Ass,<br>
Turned towards a gate that hung in view<br>
Across a shady lane; his chest<br>
Against the yielding gate he pressed<br>
And quietly passed through.<br><br>

And up the stony lane he goes;<br>
No ghost more softly ever trod;<br>
Among the stones and pebbles, he<br>
Sets down his hoofs inaudibly,<br>
As if with felt his hoofs were shod.<br><br>

Along the lane the trusty Ass<br>
Went twice two hundred yards or more,<br>
And no one could have guessed his aim,&mdash;<br>
Till to a lonely house he came,<br>
And stopped beside the door.<br><br>

Thought Peter, 'tis the poor man's home!<br>
He listens&mdash;not a sound is heard<br>
Save from the trickling household rill;<br>
But, stepping o'er the cottage-sill,<br>
Forthwith a little Girl appeared.<br><br>

She to the Meeting-house was bound<br>
In hopes some tidings there to gather:<br>
No glimpse it is, no doubtful gleam;<br>
She saw&mdash;and uttered with a scream,<br>
"My father! here's my father!"<br><br>

The very word was plainly heard,<br>
Heard plainly by the wretched Mother&mdash;<br>
Her joy was like a deep affright:<br>
And forth she rushed into the light,<br>
And saw it was another!<br><br>

And, instantly, upon the earth,<br>
Beneath the full moon shining bright,<br>
Close to the Ass's feet she fell;<br>
At the same moment Peter Bell<br>
Dismounts in most unhappy plight.<br><br>

As he beheld the Woman lie<br>
Breathless and motionless, the mind<br>
Of Peter sadly was confused;<br>
But, though to such demands unused,<br>
And helpless almost as the blind,<br><br>

He raised her up; and, while he held<br>
Her body propped against his knee,<br>
The Woman waked&mdash;and when she spied<br>
The poor Ass standing by her side,<br>
She moaned most bitterly.<br><br>

"Oh! God be praised&mdash;my heart's at ease&mdash;<br>
For he is dead&mdash;I know it well!"<br>
&mdash;At this she wept a bitter flood;<br>
And, in the best way that he could,<br>
His tale did Peter tell.<br><br>

He trembles&mdash;he is pale as death;<br>
His voice is weak with perturbation;<br>
He turns aside his head, he pauses;<br>
Poor Peter from a thousand causes,<br>
Is crippled sore in his narration.<br><br>

At length she learned how he espied<br>
The Ass in that small meadow-ground;<br>
And that her Husband now lay dead,<br>
Beside that luckless river's bed<br>
In which he had been drowned.<br><br>

A piercing look the Widow cast<br>
Upon the Beast that near her stands;<br>
She sees 'tis he, that 'tis the same;<br>
She calls the poor Ass by his name,<br>
And wrings, and wrings her hands.<br><br>

"O wretched loss&mdash;untimely stroke!<br>
If he had died upon his bed!<br>
He knew not one forewarning pain;<br>
He never will come home again&mdash;<br>
Is dead, for ever dead!"<br><br>

Beside the Woman Peter stands;<br>
His heart is opening more and more;<br>
A holy sense pervades his mind;<br>
He feels what he for human-kind<br>
Had never felt before.<br><br>

At length, by Peter's arm sustained,<br>
The Woman rises from the ground&mdash;<br>
"Oh, mercy! something must be done,<br>
My little Rachel, you must run,&mdash;<br>
Some willing neighbour must be found.<br><br>

"Make haste&mdash;my little Rachel&mdash;do,<br>
The first you meet with&mdash;bid him come,<br>
Ask him to lend his horse to-night,<br>
And this good Man, whom Heaven requite,<br>
Will help to bring the body home."<br><br>

Away goes Rachel weeping loud;&mdash;<br>
An Infant, waked by her distress,<br>
Makes in the house a piteous cry;<br>
And Peter hears the Mother sigh,<br>
"Seven are they, and all fatherless!"<br><br>

And now is Peter taught to feel<br>
That man's heart is a holy thing;<br>
And Nature, through a world of death,<br>
Breathes into him a second breath,<br>
More searching than the breath of spring.<br><br>

Upon a stone the Woman sits<br>
In agony of silent grief&mdash;<br>
From his own thoughts did Peter start;<br>
He longs to press her to his heart,<br>
From love that cannot find relief.<br><br>

But roused, as if through every limb<br>
Had past a sudden shock of dread,<br>
The Mother o'er the threshold flies,<br>
And up the cottage stairs she hies,<br>
And on the pillow lays her burning head.<br><br>

And Peter turns his steps aside<br>
Into a shade of darksome trees,<br>
Where he sits down, he knows not how,<br>
With his hands pressed against his brow,<br>
His elbows on his tremulous knees.<br><br>

There, self-involved, does Peter sit<br>
Until no sign of life he makes,<br>
As if his mind were sinking deep<br>
Through years that have been long asleep!<br>
The trance is passed away&mdash;he wakes;<br><br>

He lifts his head&mdash;and sees the Ass<br>
Yet standing in the clear moonshine;<br>
"When shall I be as good as thou?<br>
Oh! would, poor beast, that I had now<br>
A heart but half as good as thine!"<br><br>

But <i>He</i>&mdash;who deviously hath sought<br>
His Father through the lonesome woods,<br>
Hath sought, proclaiming to the ear<br>
Of night his grief and sorrowful fear&mdash;<br>
He comes, escaped from fields and floods;&mdash;<br><br>

With weary pace is drawing nigh;<br>
He sees the Ass&mdash;and nothing living<br>
Had ever such a fit of joy<br>
As hath this little orphan Boy,<br>
For he has no misgiving!<br><br>

Forth to the gentle Ass he springs,<br>
And up about his neck he climbs;<br>
In loving words he talks to him,<br>
He kisses, kisses face and limb,&mdash;<br>
He kisses him a thousand times!<br><br>

This Peter sees, while in the shade<br>
He stood beside the cottage-door;<br>
And Peter Bell, the ruffian wild,<br>
Sobs loud, he sobs even like a child,<br>
"Oh! God, I can endure no more!"<br><br>

&mdash;Here ends my Tale: for in a trice<br>
Arrived a neighbour with his horse;<br>
Peter went forth with him straightway;<br>
And, with due care, ere break of day,<br>
Together they brought back the Corse.<br><br>

And many years did this poor Ass,<br>
Whom once it was my luck to see<br>
Cropping the shrubs of Leming-Lane,<br>
Help by his labour to maintain<br>
The Widow and her family. <br><br>

And Peter Bell, who, till that night,<br>
Had been the wildest of his clan,<br>
Forsook his crimes, renounced his folly,<br>
And, after ten months' melancholy,<br>
Became a good and honest man.<br>

<a name="1K"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote K:</span></a> &nbsp;<span style="color: #555555;"> The first and second editions of <i>Peter Bell</i> (1819)
contained, as frontispiece, an engraving by J. C. Bromley, after a
picture by Sir George Beaumont. In 1807, Wordsworth wrote to Sir George:
</span>
 <blockquote> "I am quite delighted to hear of your picture for <i>Peter Bell</i> ....
  But remember that no poem of mine will ever be popular, and I am
  afraid that the sale of <i>Peter</i> would not carry the expense of
  engraving .... The people would love the poem of <i>Peter Bell</i>, but the
  <i>public</i> (a very different thing) will never love it."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Some days before Wordsworth's <i>Peter Bell</i> was issued in 1819, another
'Peter Bell' was published by Messrs. Taylor and Hessey. It was a parody
written by J. Hamilton Reynolds, and issued as 'Peter Bell, a Lyrical
Ballad', with the sentence on its title page, "I do affirm that I am the
<i>real</i> Simon Pure." The preface, which follows, is too paltry to quote;
and the stanzas which make up the poem contain allusions to the more
trivial of the early <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> (Betty Foy, Harry Gill, etc.).
Wordsworth's <i>Peter Bell</i> was published about a week later; and Shelley
afterwards published his<i> Peter Bell the Third</i>. Charles Lamb wrote to
Wordsworth, in May 1819:</span>

  <blockquote>"Dear Wordsworth&mdash;I received a copy of 'Peter Bell' a week ago, and I
  hope the author will not be offended if I say I do not much relish it.
  The humour, if it is meant for humour, is forced; and then the
  price!&mdash;sixpence would have been dear for it. Mind, I do not mean
  <i>your</i> 'Peter Bell', but <i>a Peter Bell</i>, which preceded it about a
  week, and is in every bookseller's shop window in London, the type and
  paper nothing differing from the true one, the preface signed W. W.,
  and the supplementary preface quoting, as the author's words, an
  extract from the supplementary preface to the 'Lyrical Ballads.' Is
  there no law against these rascals? I would have this Lambert Simnel
  whipt at the cart's tail."</blockquote> 

<span style="color: #555555;">(<i>The Letters of Charles Lamb</i>, edited by
  A. Ainger, vol. ii. p. 20.)<br>
<br>
Barron Field wrote on the title-page of his copy of the edition of
<i>Peter Bell</i>, 1819, </span>

 <blockquote> "And his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it."</blockquote>

<a name="1fa"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Sub-Footnote a:</span></a> &nbsp;<span style="color: #555555;">This stanza, which was deleted from every edition of
<i>Peter Bell</i> after the two of 1819, was prefixed by Shelley to his poem
of <i>Peter Bell the Third</i>, and many of his contemporaries thought that
it was an invention of Shelley's. See the note which follows this poem,
p. 50. Crabb Robinson wrote in his <i>Diary</i>, June 6, 1812: </span>

 <blockquote> "Mrs. Basil Montagu told me she had no doubt she had suggested this
  image to Wordsworth by relating to him an anecdote. A person, walking
  in a friend's garden, looking in at a window, saw a company of ladies
  at a table near the window, with countenances <i>fixed.</i> In an instant
  he was aware of their condition, and broke the window. He saved them
  from incipient suffocation." </blockquote>
  
<span style="color: #555555;">Wordsworth subsequently said that he had omitted the stanza only in
deference to the "unco guid." Crabb Robinson remonstrated with him
against its exclusion.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[July 1798. No poem of mine was composed under circumstances more
pleasant for me to remember than this. I began it upon leaving Tintern,
after crossing the Wye, and concluded it just as I was entering Bristol
in the evening, after a ramble of four or five days, with my sister. Not
a line of it was altered, and not any part of it written down till I
reached Bristol. It was published almost immediately after in the little
volume of which so much has been said in these Notes, the <i>Lyrical
Ballads,</i> as first published at Bristol by Cottle.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>

<td>Five years have past; five summers, with the length<br>
Of five long winters! and again I hear<br>
These waters, rolling from their mountain-springs<br>
With a soft inland murmur.&mdash;Once again<br>
Do I behold these steep and lofty cliffs,                      <br>
That on a wild secluded scene impress<br>
Thoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect<br>
The landscape with the quiet of the sky.<br>
The day is come when I again repose<br>
Here, under this dark sycamore, and view                      <br>
These plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts,<br>
Which at this season, with their unripe fruits,<br>
Are clad in one green hue, and lose themselves<br>
'Mid groves and copses. Once again I see<br>
These hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines             <br>
Of sportive wood run wild: these pastoral farms,<br>
Green to the very door; and wreaths of smoke<br>
Sent up, in silence, from among the trees!<br>
With some uncertain notice, as might seem<br>
Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods,                   <br>
Or of some Hermit's cave, where by his fire<br>
The Hermit sits alone.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These beauteous forms,<br>
Through a long absence, have not been to me<br>
As is a landscape to a blind man's eye:                       <br>
But oft, in lonely rooms, and 'mid the din<br>
Of towns and cities, I have owed to them,<br>
In hours of weariness, sensations sweet,<br>
Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart;<br>
And passing even into my purer mind,                      <br>
With tranquil restoration:&mdash;feelings too<br>
Of unremembered pleasure: such, perhaps,<br>
As have no slight or trivial influence<br>
On that best portion of a good man's life,<br>
His little, nameless, unremembered, acts                      <br>
Of kindness and of love. Nor less, I trust,<br>
To them I may have owed another gift,<br>
Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,<br>
In which the burthen of the mystery,<br>
In which the heavy and the weary weight                       <br>
Of all this unintelligible world,<br>
Is lightened:&mdash;that serene and blessed mood,<br>
In which the affections gently lead us on,&mdash;<br>
Until, the breath of this corporeal frame<br>
And even the motion of our human blood                        <br>
Almost suspended, we are laid asleep<br>
In body, and become a living soul:<br>
While with an eye made quiet by the power<br>
Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,<br>
We see into the life of things.                               <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this<br>
Be but a vain belief, yet, oh! how oft&mdash;<br>
In darkness and amid the many shapes<br>
Of joyless daylight; when the fretful stir<br>
Unprofitable, and the fever of the world,                     <br>
Have hung upon the beatings of my heart&mdash;<br>
How oft, in spirit, have I turned to thee,<br>
O sylvan Wye! thou wanderer thro' the woods,<br>
How often has my spirit turned to thee!<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought,        <br>
With many recognitions dim and faint,<br>
And somewhat of a sad perplexity,<br>
The picture of the mind revives again:<br>
While here I stand, not only with the sense<br>
Of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts               <br>
That in this moment there is life and food<br>
For future years. And so I dare to hope,<br>
Though changed, no doubt, from what I was when first<br>
I came among these hills; when like a roe<br>
I bounded o'er the mountains, by the sides                    <br>
Of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams,<br>
Wherever nature led: more like a man<br>
Flying from something that he dreads, than one<br>
Who sought the thing he loved. For nature then<br>
(The coarser pleasures of my boyish days,                     <br>
And their glad animal movements all gone by)<br>
To me was all in all.&mdash;I cannot paint<br>
What then I was. The sounding cataract<br>
Haunted me like a passion: the tall rock,<br>
The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,                   <br>
Their colours and their forms, were then to me<br>
An appetite; a feeling and a love,<br>
That had no need of a remoter charm,<br>
By thought supplied, nor any interest<br>
Unborrowed from the eye.&mdash;That time is past,                  <br>
And all its aching joys are now no more,<br>
And all its dizzy raptures. Not for this<br>
Faint I, nor mourn nor murmur; other gifts<br>
Have followed; for such loss, I would believe,<br>
Abundant recompence. For I have learned                       <br>
To look on nature, not as in the hour<br>
Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes<br>
The still, sad music of humanity,<br>
Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power<br>
To chasten and subdue. And I have felt                        <br>
A presence that disturbs me with the joy<br>
Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime<br>
Of something far more deeply interfused,<br>
Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,<br>
And the round ocean and the living air,                      <br>
And the blue sky, and in the mind of man:<br>
A motion and a spirit, that impels<br>
All thinking things, all objects of all thought,<br>
And rolls through all things. Therefore am I still<br>
A lover of the meadows and the woods,                        <br>
And mountains; and of all that we behold<br>
From this green earth; of all the mighty world<br>
Of eye, and ear,&mdash;both what they half create,<br>
And what perceive; well pleased to recognise<br>
In nature and the language of the sense,                     <br>
The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,<br>
The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul<br>
Of all my moral being.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor perchance,<br>
If I were not thus taught, should I the more                 <br>
Suffer my genial spirits to decay:<br>
For thou art with me here upon the banks<br>
Of this fair river; thou my dearest Friend,<br>
My dear, dear Friend; and in thy voice I catch<br>
The language of my former heart, and read                    <br>
My former pleasures in the shooting lights<br>
Of thy wild eyes, Oh! yet a little while<br>
May I behold in thee what I was once,<br>
My dear, dear Sister! and this prayer I make,<br>
Knowing that Nature never did betray                         <br>
The heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege,<br>
Through all the years of this our life, to lead<br>
From joy to joy: for she can so inform<br>
The mind that is within us, so impress<br>
With quietness and beauty, and so feed                       <br>
With lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues,<br>
Rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men,<br>
Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all<br>
The dreary intercourse of daily life,<br>
Shall e'er prevail against us, or disturb                    <br>
Our cheerful faith, that all which we behold<br>
Is full of blessings. Therefore let the moon<br>
Shine on thee in thy solitary walk;<br>
And let the misty mountain-winds be free<br>
To blow against thee: and, in after years,                   <br>
When these wild ecstasies shall be matured<br>
Into a sober pleasure; when thy mind<br>
Shall be a mansion for all lovely forms,<br>
Thy memory be as a dwelling-place<br>
For all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then,                <br>
If solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,<br>
Should be thy portion, with what healing thoughts<br>
Of tender joy wilt thou remember me,<br>
And these my exhortations! Nor, perchance&mdash;<br>
If I should be where I no more can hear                      <br>
Thy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams<br>
Of past existence&mdash;wilt thou then forget<br>
That on the banks of this delightful stream<br>
We stood together; and that I, so long<br>
A worshipper of Nature, hither came                          <br>
Unwearied in that service: rather say<br>
With warmer love&mdash;oh! with far deeper zeal<br>
Of holier love. Nor wilt thou then forget,<br>
That after many wanderings, many years<br>
Of absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs,              <br>
And this green pastoral landscape, were to me<br>
More dear, both for themselves and for thy sake!<br>

<a href="#section3a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[Written in Germany, 1799. This is an extract from the Poem on my own
poetical education. This practice of making an instrument of their own
fingers is known to most boys, though some are more skilful at it than
others. William Raincock of Rayrigg, a fine spirited lad, took the lead
of all my schoolfellows in this art.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">This "extract" will be found in the fifth book of <i>The Prelude</i>, ll.
364-397. It was included among the "Poems of the Imagination." In the
editions of 1800 to 1832 it had no title, except in the table of
contents. In 1836, the finally adopted title of the poem was given in
the text, as well as in the table of contents.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<td>There was a Boy; ye knew him well, ye cliffs<br>
And islands of Winander!&mdash;many a time,<br>
At evening, when the earliest stars began<br>
To move along the edges of the hills,<br>
Rising or setting, would he stand alone,                        <br>
Beneath the trees, or by the glimmering lake;<br>
And there, with fingers interwoven, both hands<br>
Pressed closely palm to palm and to his mouth<br>
Uplifted, he, as through an instrument,<br>
Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls,                        <br>
That they might answer him.&mdash;And they would shout<br>
Across the watery vale, and shout again,<br>
Responsive to his call,&mdash;with quivering peals,<br>
And long halloos, and screams, and echoes loud<br>
Redoubled and redoubled; concourse wild                        <br>
Of jocund din! And, when there came a pause<br>
Of silence such as baffled his best skill:<br>
Then, sometimes, in that silence, while he hung<br>
Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprise<br>
Has carried far into his heart the voice                       <br>
Of mountain-torrents; or the visible scene<br>
Would enter unawares into his mind<br>
With all its solemn imagery, its rocks,<br>
Its woods, and that uncertain heaven received<br>
Into the bosom of the steady lake. <br>
                            <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This boy was taken from his mates, and died<br>
In childhood, ere he was full twelve years old.<br>
Pre-eminent in beauty is the vale<br>
Where he was born and bred: the church-yard hangs<br>
Upon a slope above the village-school;                         <br>
And, through that church-yard when my way has led<br>
On summer-evenings, I believe, that there<br>
A long half-hour together I have stood<br>
Mute&mdash;looking at the grave in which he lies!<br>

<a name="3n1"></a><span style="color: #555555;">Wordsworth sent this fragment in MS. to Coleridge, who was then living
at Ratzeburg, and Coleridge wrote in reply on the 10th Dec. 1798:</span>

 <blockquote> "The blank lines gave me as much direct pleasure as was possible in
  the general bustle of pleasure with which I received and read your
  letter. I observed, I remember, that the 'fingers woven,' etc., only
  puzzled me; and though I liked the twelve or fourteen first lines very
  well, yet I liked the remainder much better. Well, now I have read
  them again, they are very beautiful, and leave an affecting
  impression. That

  <blockquote>  'uncertain heaven received<br>
    Into the bosom of the steady lake,'</blockquote>

  I should have recognised anywhere; and had I met these lines, running
  wild in the deserts of Arabia, I should have instantly screamed out
  'Wordsworth'!"</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The MS. copy of this poem sent to Coleridge probably lacked
the explanatory line,</span>

 <blockquote> 'Pressed closely palm to palm and to his mouth,'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">as another MS., in the possession of the poet's grandson, lacks it; and
the line was possibly added&mdash;as the late Mr. Dykes Campbell
suggested&mdash;"in deference to S. T. C.'s expression of puzzlement."<br>
<br>
Fletcher <a name="fr3B">Raincock&mdash;an</a> elder brother of the William Raincock referred to
in the Fenwick note to this poem, as Wordsworth's schoolfellow at
Hawkshead&mdash;was with him also at Cambridge. He attended Pembroke College,
and was second wrangler in 1790<a href="#3B"><sup>B</sup></a>. John Fleming of Rayrigg, his
half-brother&mdash;the boy with whom Wordsworth used to walk round the lake
of Esthwaite, in the morning before school-time, ("five miles of
pleasant wandering")&mdash;was also at St. John's College, Cambridge, at this
time, and had been fifth Wrangler in the preceding year, 1789. He is
referred to both in the second and the fifth books of <i>The Prelude</i>
(see notes to that poem). It is perhaps not unworthy of note that
Wrangham, whose French stanzas on "The Birth of Love" Wordsworth
translated into English, was in the same year&mdash;1789&mdash;third Wrangler,
second Smith's prizeman, and first Chancellor's medallist; while Robert
Greenwood, "the Minstrel of the Troop," who "blew his flute, alone upon
the rock" in Windermere,&mdash;also one of the characters referred to in the
second book of <i>The Prelude</i>,&mdash;was sixteenth Wrangler in
Wordsworth's year, viz. 1791. William Raincock was at St. John's
College, Cambridge.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

when a boy at Hawkshead School. Daniel was more than eighty years older

have so early taught me to think of the changes to which human life is
subject, and while looking at him I could not but say to myself&mdash;we may,
one of us, I or the happiest of my playmates, live to become still more
the object of pity, than this old man, this half-doating

<td>O now that the genius of Bewick were mine,<br>
And the skill which he learned on the banks of the Tyne,<br>
Then the Muses might deal with me just as they chose,<br>
For I'd take my last leave both of verse and of prose.<br><br>

What feats would I work with my magical hand!                     <br>
Book-learning and books should be banished the land:<br>
And, for hunger and thirst and such troublesome calls,<br>
Every ale-house should then have a feast on its walls.<br><br>

The traveller would hang his wet clothes on a chair;<br>
Let them smoke, let them burn, not a straw would he care!        <br>
For the Prodigal Son, Joseph's Dream and his sheaves,<br>
Oh, what would they be to my tale of two Thieves?<br><br>

The One, yet unbreeched, is not three birthdays old,<br>
His Grandsire that age more than thirty times told;<br>
There are ninety good seasons of fair and foul weather           <br>
Between them, and both go a-pilfering together.<br><br>

With chips is the carpenter strewing his floor?<br>
Is a cart-load of turf at an old woman's door?<br>
Old Daniel his hand to the treasure will slide!<br>
And his Grandson's as busy at work by his side.                  <br><br>

Old Daniel begins; he stops short&mdash;and his eye,<br>
Through the lost look of dotage, is cunning and sly:<br>
'Tis a look which at this time is hardly his own,<br>
But tells a plain tale of the days that are flown.<br><br>

He once had a heart which was moved by the wires             <br>
Of manifold pleasures and many desires:<br>
And what if he cherished his purse? 'Twas no more<br>
Than treading a path trod by thousands before.<br><br>

'Twas a path trod by thousands; but Daniel is one<br>
Who went something farther than others have gone,            <br>
And now with old Daniel you see how it fares;<br>
You see to what end he has brought his grey hairs.<br><br>

The pair sally forth hand in hand: ere the sun<br>
Has peered o'er the beeches, their work is begun:<br>
And yet, into whatever sin they may fall,                        <br>
This child but half knows it, and that not at all.<br><br>

They hunt through the streets with deliberate tread,<br>
And each, in his turn, becomes leader or led;<br>
And, wherever they carry their plots and their wiles,<br>
Every face in the village is dimpled with smiles.                <br><br>

Neither checked by the rich nor the needy they roam;<br>
For the grey-headed Sire has a daughter at home,<br>
Who will gladly repair all the damage that's done;<br>
And three, were it asked, would be rendered for one.<br><br>

Old Man! whom so oft I with pity have eyed,                      <br>
I love thee, and love the sweet Boy at thy side:<br>
Long yet may'st thou live! for a teacher we see<br>
That lifts up the veil of our nature in thee.<br>

<td>Stranger! this hillock of mis-shapen stones                   <br>
Is not a Ruin spared or made by time,<br>
Nor, as perchance thou rashly deem'st, the Cairn<br>
Of some old British Chief: 'tis nothing more<br>
Than the rude embryo of a little Dome                          <br>
Or Pleasure-house, once destined to be built<br>
Among the birch-trees of this rocky isle.<br>
But, as it chanced, Sir William having learned<br>
That from the shore a full-grown man might wade,<br>
And make himself a freeman of this spot                       <br>
At any hour he chose, the prudent Knight<br>
Desisted, and the quarry and the mound<br>
Are monuments of his unfinished task.<br>
The block on which these lines are traced, perhaps,<br>
Was once selected as the corner-stone                         <br>
Of that intended Pile, which would have been<br>
Some quaint odd plaything of elaborate skill,<br>
So that, I guess, the linnet and the thrush,<br>
And other little builders who dwell here,<br>
Had wondered at the work. But blame him not,                  <br>
For old Sir William was a gentle Knight,<br>
Bred in this vale, to which he appertained<br>
With all his ancestry. Then peace to him,<br>
And for the outrage which he had devised<br>
Entire forgiveness!&mdash;But if thou art one                      <br>
On fire with thy impatience to become<br>
An inmate of these mountains,&mdash;if, disturbed<br>
By beautiful conceptions, thou hast hewn<br>
Out of the quiet rock the elements<br>
Of thy trim Mansion destined soon to blaze                    <br>
In snow-white splendour,&mdash;think again; and, taught<br>
By old Sir William and his quarry, leave<br>
Thy fragments to the bramble and the rose;<br>
There let the vernal slow-worm sun himself,<br>
And let the redbreast hop from stone to stone.<br>
