<h2><a name="section51"></a>1801</h2>

<span style="color: #555555;"><i>The Sparrow's Nest</i>, and the sonnet on Skiddaw, along with some
translations from Chaucer, belong to the year 1801. During this year,
however, <i>The Excursion</i> was in progress. In its earlier stages, and
before the plan of 'The Recluse' was matured, the introductory part was
familiarly known, and talked of in the Wordsworth household, by the name
of "The Pedlar." The following extracts from Dorothy Wordsworth's
Journal of 1801 will show the progress that was being made with it:</span>

  <blockquote>"Dec. 21.&mdash;Wm. sate beside me, and wrote <i>The Pedlar.</i> <br>
<br>
22nd.&mdash;W.
  composed a few lines of <i>The Pedlar.</i> <br>
<br>
23rd.&mdash; William worked at <i>The
  Ruined Cottage</i>" (this was the name of the first part of 'The
  Excursion', in which <i>The Pedlar</i> was included), "and made himself
  very ill," etc.</blockquote>

<h2><a name="section52"></a>The Sparrow's Nest</h2>

<h4>Composed 1801.&mdash;Published 1807</h4>

<a href="#section52a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[<a name="fr52A">Written</a> in the orchard, Town-end, Grasmere. At the end of the garden of
my father's house at Cockermouth was a high terrace that commanded a
fine view of the river Derwent and Cockermouth Castle. This was our
favourite play-ground. The terrace wall, a low one, was covered with
closely-clipt privet and roses, which gave an almost impervious shelter
to birds who built their nests there. The latter of these stanzas<a href="#52A"><sup>A</sup></a>
alludes to one of those nests.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">This poem was first published in the series entitled "Moods of my own
Mind," in 1807. In 1815 it was included among the "Poems founded on the
Affections," and in 1845 was transferred to the "Poems referring to the
Period of Childhood." &mdash;Ed.</span><br>

Those bright blue eggs together laid!<br>
On me the chance-discovered sight<br>
Gleamed like a vision of delight.<br>
I started&mdash;seeming to espy <br>

The Sparrow's dwelling, which, hard by<br>
My Father's house, in wet or dry<br>
My sister Emmeline and I<br>
    Together visited.<br><br>

She looked at it and seemed to fear it;<br>
Dreading, tho' wishing, to be near it:<br>
Such heart was in her, being then<br>
A little Prattler among men.<br>
The Blessing of my later years<br>
Was with me when a boy:<br>
She gave me eyes, she gave me ears;<br>
And humble cares, and delicate fears;<br>
A heart, the fountain of sweet tears;<br>
    And love, and thought, and joy.<br>

<h2><a name="section54"></a>Selections from Chaucer (Modernised)</h2>

<span style="color: #555555;">Wordsworth's modernisations of Chaucer were all written in 1801. Two of
them were from the Canterbury Tales, but his version of one of
these&mdash;<i>The Manciple's Tale</i>&mdash;has never been printed. Of the three
poems which were published, the first&mdash;<i>The Prioress' Tale</i>&mdash;was
included in the edition of 1820. The <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> and
<i>The Cuckoo and the Nightingale</i> were included in the "Poems of
Early and Late Years" (1842); but they had been published the year
before, in a small volume entitled <i>The Poems of Geoffrey Chaucer
Modernised</i> (London, 1841), a volume to which Elizabeth Barrett,
Leigh Hunt, R. H. Home, Thomas Powell, and others contributed.
Wordsworth wrote thus of the project to Mr. Powell, in an unpublished
and undated letter, written probably in 1840:</span>

  <blockquote>"I am glad that you enter so warmly into the Chaucerian project, and
  that Mr. L. Hunt is disposed to give his valuable aid to it. For
  myself, I cannot do more than I offered, to place at your disposal
  <i>The Prioress' Tale</i> already published, <i>The Cuckoo and the
  Nightingale</i>, <i>The Manciple's Tale</i>, and I rather think (but I
  cannot just now find it) a small portion of the <i>Troilus and
  Cressida</i>. You ask my opinion about that poem. Speaking from a
  recollection only, of many years past, I should say it would be found
  too long and probably tedious. <i>The Knight's Tale</i> is also very
  long; but, though Dryden has executed it, in his own way observe, with
  great spirit and harmony, he has suffered so much of the simplicity,
  and with that of the beauty and occasional pathos of the original to
  escape, that I should be pleased to hear that a new version was to be
  attempted upon my principle by some competent person. It would delight
  me to read every part of Chaucer over again&mdash;for I reverence and
  admire him above measure&mdash;with a view to your work; but my eyes will
  not permit me to do so. Who will undertake the Prologue to the
  Canterbury Tales? For your publication that is indispensable, and I
  fear it will prove very difficult. It is written, as you know, in the
  couplet measure; and therefore I have nothing to say upon its metre,
  but in respect to the poems in stanza, neither in <i>The Prioress'
  Tale</i> nor in <i>The Cuckoo and Nightingale</i> have I kept to the
  rule of the original as to the form, and number, and position of the
  rhymes; thinking it enough if I kept the same number of lines in each
  stanza; and this is, I think, all that is necessary, and all that can
  be done without sacrificing the substance of sense too often to the
  mere form of sound."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">In a subsequent letter to Professor Henry Reed of Philadelphia, dated
"Rydal Mount, January 13th, 1841," Wordsworth said:</span>

  <blockquote>"So great is my admiration of Chaucer's genius, and so profound my
  reverence for him as an instrument in the hands of Providence, for
  spreading the light of literature through his native land, that
  notwithstanding the defects and faults in this publication"
  (referring, I presume, to the volume, <i>The Poems of Geoffrey Chaucer
  Modernised</i>), "I am glad of it, as a means of making many acquainted
  with the original, who would otherwise be ignorant of everything about
  him but his name."</blockquote>

<h2><a name="section55"></a>The Prioress' Tale</h2>

<h4>Translated 1801<a href="#55A"><sup>A</sup></a>.&mdash;Published 1820</h4>

<a href="#section55a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<blockquote>"<a name="fr55B">Call</a> up him who left half told<br>
The story of Cambuscan bold."<a href="#55B"><sup>B</sup></a></blockquote>

In the following Piece I have allowed myself no farther deviations from
the original than were necessary for the fluent reading, and instant
understanding, of the Author: so much however is the language altered
since Chaucer's time, especially in pronunciation, that much was to be
removed, and its place supplied with as little incongruity as possible.
The ancient accent has been retained in a few conjunctions, such as
<i>also</i> and <i>alway</i>, from a conviction that such sprinklings of antiquity
would be admitted, by persons of taste, to have a graceful accordance
with the subject.&mdash;W. W. (1820).<br>
<br>
The fierce bigotry of the Prioress forms a fine back ground for her
tender-hearted sympathies with the Mother and Child; and the mode in
which the story is told amply atones for the extravagance of the
miracle.&mdash; W. W. (added in 1827).<br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">In the editions of 1820 and 1827 <i>The Prioress' Tale</i> followed <i>The
White Doe of Rylstone</i>. In 1832 it followed the "Inscriptions"; and in
1836 it was included among the "Poems founded on the Affections." In
1845 it found its appropriate place in the "Selections from Chaucer
modernised."&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

show the date of the composition of this poem. </span>

 <blockquote> "Sunday, 6th December 1801. A very fine beautiful sun-shiny morning.
  William worked a while at Chaucer; then he set forward to walk into
  Easdale.... In the afternoon I read Chaucer aloud."<br>
<br>
  "Monday, 7th.... William at work with Chaucer, <i>The God of
  Love</i>...."<br>
<br>
  "8th November ... William worked at <i>The Cuckoo and the
  Nightingale</i> till he was tired."<br>
<br>
  "Wednesday, December 9th. I read <i>Palemon and Arcite</i>, William
  writing out his alterations of Chaucer's <i>Cuckoo and
  Nightingale</i>." </blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The question as to whether <i>The Cuckoo and the Nightingale</i> was
written by Chaucer or not, may be solved either way without affecting
the literary value of Wordsworth's "modernisation" of it.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<a name="56C"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote C:</span></a> &nbsp;

 <blockquote> "In <i>The Cuckoo and Nightingale</i>, a poem of the third of May&mdash;a
  date corresponding to the mid-May, the very heart of May according to
  our modern reckoning&mdash;the poet after a wakeful night rises, and goes
  forth at dawn, and comes to a 'laund' or plain 'of white and green.'

   <blockquote> 'So feire oon had I nevere in bene,<br>
    The grounde was grene, y poudred with days&eacute;,<br>
    The floures and the gras ilike al hie,<br>
    Al grene and white, was nothing elles sene.'</blockquote>

  Nothing seen but the short green grass and the white daisies,&mdash;grass
  and daisies being of equal height. Unfortunately in Tyrwhitt's text
  the description is nonsensical,

   <blockquote> 'The flowres and the greves like hie.'</blockquote>

  The daisy flowers are as high as the <i>groves</i>! Wordsworth retained the
  groves, but refused to make daisies of equal height with them.

    <blockquote>'Tall were the flowers, the grove a lofty cover,
    All green and white; and nothing else was seen.'"</blockquote></blockquote>

<a href="#fr56C">return</a><br>

<br>
<a name="56D"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote D:</span></a> &nbsp;

 <blockquote> "In Chaucer's poem, after 'the cuckoo, bird unholy,' has said his evil
  say, the Nightingale breaks forth 'so lustily,'

   <blockquote> 'That with her clere voys she made rynge<br>
    Thro out alle the grene wode wide,'</blockquote>

  Wordsworth has taken a poet's licence with these lines:

   <blockquote> 'I heard the lusty Nightingale so sing,<br>
    That her clear voice made <i>a loud rioting</i>,<br>
    Echoing through all the green wood wide.'</blockquote>

  This 'loud rioting' is Wordsworth's, not Chaucer's; and it belongs, as
  it were, to that other passage of his:

   <blockquote> 'O Nightingale, thou surely art<br>
    A creature of a fiery heart,<br>
    These notes of thine&mdash;they pierce and pierce;<br>
    Tumultuous harmony and fierce!<br>
    Thou sing'st as if the God of wine<br>
    Had helped thee to a Valentine.'"</blockquote></blockquote>

<td>Next morning Troilus began to clear                             <br>
His eyes from sleep, at the first break of day,<br>
And unto Pandarus, his own Brother dear,<br>
For love of God, full piteously did say,<br>
We must the Palace see of Cresida;                              <br>
For since we yet may have no other feast,<br>
Let us behold her Palace at the least!<br><br>

And therewithal to cover his intent<br>
A cause he found into the Town to go,<br>
And they right forth to Cresid's Palace went;                  <br>
But, Lord, this simple Troilus was woe,<br>
Him thought his sorrowful heart would break in two;<br>
For when he saw her doors fast bolted all,<br>
Well nigh for sorrow down he 'gan to fall.<br><br>

Therewith when this true Lover 'gan behold,                    <br>
How shut was every window of the place,<br>
Like frost he thought his heart was icy cold;<br>
For which, with chang&egrave;d, pale, and deadly face,<br>
Without word uttered, forth he 'gan to pace;<br>
And on his purpose bent so fast to ride,                       <br>
That no wight his continuance espied.<br><br>

Then said he thus,&mdash;O Palace desolate!<br>
O house of houses, once so richly dight!<br>
O Palace empty and disconsolate!<br>
Thou lamp of which extinguished is the light;                  <br>
O Palace whilom day that now art night,<br>
Thou ought'st to fall and I to die; since she<br>
Is gone who held us both in sovereignty.<br><br>

O, of all houses once the crown&egrave;d boast!<br>
Palace illumined with the sun of bliss;                        <br>
O ring of which the ruby now is lost,<br>
O cause of woe, that cause has been of bliss:<br>
Yet, since I may no better, would I kiss<br>
Thy cold doors; but I dare not for this rout;<br>
Farewell, thou shrine of which the Saint is out!<br><br>

Therewith he cast on Pandarus an eye,<br>
With changed face, and piteous to behold;<br>
And when he might his time aright espy,<br>
Aye as he rode, to Pandarus he told<br>
Both his new sorrow and his joys of old,                       <br>
So piteously, and with so dead a hue,<br>
That every wight might on his sorrow rue.<br><br>

Forth from the spot he rideth up and down,<br>
And everything to his rememberance<br>
Came as he rode by places of the town                          <br>
Where he had felt such perfect pleasure once.<br>
Lo, yonder saw I mine own Lady dance,<br>
And in that Temple she with her bright eyes,<br>
My Lady dear, first bound me captive-wise.<br><br>

And yonder with joy-smitten heart have I                       <br>
Heard my own Cresid's laugh; and once at play<br>
I yonder saw her eke full blissfully;<br>
And yonder once she unto me 'gan say&mdash;<br>
Now, my sweet Troilus, love me well, I pray!<br>
And there so graciously did me behold,                         <br>
That hers unto the death my heart I hold.<br><br>

And at the corner of that self-same house<br>
Heard I my most beloved Lady dear,<br>
So womanly, with voice melodious<br>
Singing so well, so goodly, and so clear,                      <br>
That in my soul methinks I yet do hear<br>
The blissful sound; and in that very place<br>
My Lady first me took unto her grace.<br><br>

O blissful God of Love! then thus he cried,<br>
When I the process have in memory,                             <br>
How thou hast wearied me on every side,<br>
Men thence a book might make, a history;<br>
What need to seek a conquest over me,<br>
Since I am wholly at thy will? what joy<br>
Hast thou thy own liege subjects to destroy?<br><br>

Dread Lord! so fearful when provoked, thine ire<br>
Well hast thou wreaked on me by pain and grief;<br>
Now mercy, Lord! thou know'st well I desire<br>
Thy grace above all pleasures first and chief;<br>
And live and die I will in thy belief;                         <br>
For which I ask for guerdon but one boon,<br>
That Cresida again thou send me soon.<br><br>

Constrain her heart as quickly to return,<br>
As thou dost mine with longing her to see,<br>
Then know I well that she would not sojourn.                   <br>
Now, blissful Lord, so cruel do not be<br>
Unto the blood of Troy, I pray of thee,<br>
As Juno was unto the Theban blood,<br>
From whence to Thebes came griefs in multitude.<br><br>

And after this he to the gate did go                           <br>
Whence Cresid rode, as if in haste she was;<br>
And up and down there went, and to and fro,<br>
And to himself full oft he said, alas!<br>
From hence my hope, and solace forth did pass.<br>
O would the blissful God now for his joy,                      <br>
I might her see again coming to Troy!<br><br>

And up to yonder hill was I her guide;<br>
Alas, and there I took of her my leave;<br>
Yonder I saw her to her Father ride,<br>
For very grief of which my heart shall cleave;&mdash;               <br>
And hither home I came when it was eve;<br>
And here I dwell an outcast from all joy,<br>
And shall, unless I see her soon in Troy.<br><br>

And of himself did he imagine oft,<br>
That he was blighted, pale, and waxen less                    <br>
Than he was wont; and that in whispers soft<br>
Men said, what may it be, can no one guess<br>
Why Troilus hath all this heaviness?<br>
All which he of himself conceited wholly<br>
Out of his weakness and his melancholy.<br><br>

Another time he took into his head,<br>
That every wight, who in the way passed by,<br>
Had of him ruth, and fancied that they said,<br>
I am right sorry Troilus will die:<br>
And thus a day or two drove wearily;                          <br>
As ye have heard; such life 'gan he to lead<br>
As one that standeth betwixt hope and dread.<br><br>

For which it pleased him in his songs to show<br>
The occasion of his woe, as best he might;<br>
And made a fitting song, of words but few,                <br>
Somewhat his woeful heart to make more light;<br>
And when he was removed from all men's sight,<br>
With a soft night voice, he of his Lady dear,<br>
That absent was, 'gan sing as ye may hear.<br><br>

O star, of which I lost have all the light,                   <br>
With a sore heart well ought I to bewail,<br>
That ever dark in torment, night by night,<br>
Toward my death with wind I steer and sail;<br>
For which upon the tenth night if thou fail<br>
With thy bright beams to guide me but one hour,               <br>
My ship and me Charybdis will devour.<br><br>

As soon as he this song had thus sung through,<br>
He fell again into his sorrows old;<br>
And every night, as was his wont to do,<br>
Troilus stood the bright moon to behold;                      <br>
And all his trouble to the moon he told,<br>
And said; I wis, when thou art horn'd anew,<br>
I shall be glad if all the world be true.<br><br>

Thy horns were old as now upon that morrow,<br>
When hence did journey my bright Lady dear,                   <br>
That cause is of my torment and my sorrow;<br>
For which, oh, gentle Luna, bright and clear,<br>
For love of God, run fast above thy sphere;<br>
For when thy horns begin once more to spring,<br>
Then shall she come, that with her bliss may bring. <br><br>

The day is more, and longer every night<br>
Than they were wont to be&mdash;for he thought so;<br>
And that the sun did take his course not right,<br>
By longer way than he was wont to go;<br>
And said, I am in constant dread I trow,                      <br>
That Ph&auml;eton his son is yet alive,<br>
His too fond father's car amiss to drive.<br><br>

Upon the walls fast also would he walk,<br>
To the end that he the Grecian host might see;<br>
And ever thus he to himself would talk:&mdash;                     <br>
Lo! yonder is my own bright Lady free;<br>
Or yonder is it that the tents must be;<br>
And thence does come this air which is so sweet,<br>
That in my soul I feel the joy of it.<br><br>

And certainly this wind, that more and more                   <br>
By moments thus increaseth in my face,<br>
Is of my Lady's sighs heavy and sore;<br>
I prove it thus; for in no other space<br>
Of all this town, save only in this place,<br>
Feel I a wind, that soundeth so like pain;                    <br>
It saith, Alas, why severed are we twain?<br><br>

A weary while in pain he tosseth thus,<br>
Till fully past and gone was the ninth night;<br>
And ever at his side stood Pandarus,<br>
Who busily made use of all his might                          <br>
To comfort him, and make his heart more light;<br>
Giving him always hope, that she the morrow<br>
Of the tenth day will come, and end his sorrow.<br>
