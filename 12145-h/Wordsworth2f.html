<h2><a name="section58"></a>1802</h2>

<span style="color: #555555;">The Lyrical Ballads and Sonnets which follow were written
in 1802; but during that year Wordsworth continued mainly to
work at <i>The Excursion</i>, as the following extracts from his sister's
Journal indicate:</span>

  <blockquote>"Feb. 1, 1802.&mdash;William worked hard at <i>The Pedlar,</i> and tired
  himself.<br>
<br>
  2nd Feb.&mdash;Wm. worked at <i>The Pedlar</i>. I read aloud the 11th book of
  <i>Paradise Lost</i>.<br>
<br>
  Thursday, 4th.&mdash;William thought a little about <i>The Pedlar.</i><br>
<br>
  5th.&mdash;Wm. sate up late at <i>The Pedlar</i>.<br>
<br>
  7th.&mdash;W. was working at his poem. Wm. read <i>The Pedlar,</i> thinking it
  was done. But lo! ... it was uninteresting, and must be altered."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Similar records occur each day in the Journal from the 10th to the 14th
Feb. 1802.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[Written in Town-end, Grasmere. I met this woman near the Wishing-gate,

<td>One morning (raw it was and wet&mdash;<br>
A foggy day in winter time)<br>
A Woman on the road I met,<br>
Not old, though something past her prime:<br>
Majestic in her person, tall and straight;<br>
And like a Roman matron's was her mien and gait.<br><br>

The ancient spirit is not dead;<br>
Old times, thought I, are breathing there;<br>
Proud was I that my country bred<br>
Such strength, a dignity so fair:<br>
She begged an alms, like one in poor estate;<br>
I looked at her again, nor did my pride abate.<br><br>

When from these lofty thoughts I woke,<br>
"What is it," said I, "that you bear,<br>
Beneath the covert of your Cloak,<br>
Protected from this cold damp air?"<br>
She answered, soon as she the question heard,<br>
"A simple burthen, Sir, a little Singing-bird."<br><br>

And, thus continuing, she said,<br>
"I had a Son, who many a day<br>
Sailed on the seas, but he is dead;<br>
In Denmark he was cast away:<br>
And I have travelled weary miles to see<br>
If aught which he had owned might still remain for me.<br><br>

"The bird and cage they both were his:<br>
'Twas my Son's bird; and neat and trim<br>
He kept it: many voyages<br>
The singing-bird had gone with him;<br>
When last he sailed, he left the bird behind;<br>
From bodings, as might be, that hung upon his mind.<br><br>

"He to a fellow-lodger's care<br>
Had left it, to be watched and fed,<br>
And pipe its song in safety;&mdash;there<br>
I found it when my Son was dead;<br>
And now, God help me for my little wit!<br>
I bear [8] it with me, Sir;&mdash;he took so much delight in it."<br>

<h4>Composed March 12th and 13th, 1802.&mdash;Published 1807</h4>

<a href="#section60a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[Written to gratify Mr. Graham of Glasgow, brother of the author of <i>The
Sabbath</i>. He was a zealous coadjutor of Mr. Clarkson, and a man of
ardent humanity. The incident had happened to himself, and he urged me
to put it into verse, for humanity's sake. The humbleness, meanness if
you like, of the subject, together with the homely mode of treating it,
brought upon me a world of ridicule by the small critics, so that in
policy I excluded it from many editions of my poems, till it was
restored at the request of some of my friends, in particular my
son-in-law, Edward Quillinan.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">It was only excluded from the editions of 1820, 1827, and 1832. In the
edition of 1807 it was placed amongst a group of "Poems composed during
a Tour, chiefly on foot." In 1815, in 1836, and afterwards, it was
included in the group "referring to the Period of Childhood."<br>
<br>
In Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Grasmere Journal,</i> the following reference to
this poem occurs:</span>

  <blockquote>"Feb. 16, 1802.&mdash;Mr. Graham said he wished William had been with him
  the other day. He was riding in a post-chaise, and he heard a strange
  cry that he could not understand. The sound continued, and he called
  to the chaise-driver to stop. It was a little girl that was crying as
  if her heart would burst. She had got up behind the chaise, and her
  cloak had been caught by the wheel, and was jammed in, and it hung
  there. She was crying after it, poor thing. Mr. Graham took her into
  the chaise, and her cloak was released from the wheel, but the child's
  misery did not cease, for her cloak was torn to rags. It had been a
  miserable cloak before; but she had no other, and it was the greatest
  sorrow that could befall her. Her name was Alice Fell. She had no
  parents, and belonged to the next town. At the next town Mr. G. left
  money to buy her a new cloak."<br>
<br>
  "Friday (March 12).&mdash;In the evening after tea William wrote <i>Alice
  Fell</i>." <br>
<br>
"Saturday Morning (13th March).&mdash;William finished <i>Alice
  Fell</i>...."</blockquote>

<td>The post-boy drove with fierce career,<br>
For threatening clouds the moon had drowned;<br>
When, as we hurried on, my ear<br>
Was smitten with a startling sound.<br><br>

As if the wind blew many ways,<br>
I heard the sound,&mdash;and more and more;<br>
It seemed to follow with the chaise,<br>
And still I heard it as before.<br><br>

At length I to the boy called out;<br>
He stopped his horses at the word,<br>
But neither cry, nor voice, nor shout,<br>
Nor aught else like it, could be heard.<br><br>

The boy then smacked his whip, and fast<br>
The horses scampered through the rain;<br>
But, hearing soon upon the blast<br>
The cry, I bade him halt again.<br><br>

Forthwith alighting on the ground,<br>
"Whence comes," said I, "this piteous moan?"<br>
And there a little Girl I found,<br>
Sitting behind the chaise, alone.<br><br>

"My cloak!" no other word she spake,<br>
But loud and bitterly she wept,<br>
As if her innocent heart would break;<br>
And down from off her seat she leapt.<br><br>

"What ails you, child?"&mdash;she sobbed "Look here!"<br>
I saw it in the wheel entangled,<br>
A weather-beaten rag as e'er<br>
From any garden scare-crow dangled.<br><br>

There, twisted between nave and spoke,<br>
It hung, nor could at once be freed;<br>
But our joint pains unloosed the cloak,<br>
A miserable rag indeed!<br><br>

"And whither are you going, child,<br>
To-night along these lonesome ways?"<br>
"To Durham," answered she, half wild&mdash;<br>
"Then come with me into the chaise."<br><br>

Insensible to all relief<br>
Sat the poor girl, and forth did send<br>
Sob after sob, as if her grief<br>
Could never, never have an end.<br><br>

"My child, in Durham do you dwell?"<br>
She checked herself in her distress,<br>
And said, "My name is Alice Fell;<br>
I'm fatherless and motherless.<br><br>

"And I to Durham, Sir, belong."<br>
Again, as if the thought would choke<br>
Her very heart, her grief grew strong;<br>
And all was for her tattered cloak!<br><br>

The chaise drove on; our journey's end<br>
Was nigh; and, sitting by my side,<br>
As if she had lost her only friend<br>
She wept, nor would be pacified.<br><br>

Up to the tavern-door we post;<br>
Of Alice and her grief I told;<br>
And I gave money to the host,<br>
To buy a new cloak for the old.<br><br>

"And let it be of duffil grey,<br>
As warm a cloak as man can sell!"<br>
Proud creature was she the next day,<br>
The little orphan, Alice Fell!<br>

<h2><a name="section61"></a>Beggars</h2>

<h4>Composed March 13th and 14th, 1802.&mdash;Published 1807</h4>

<a href="#section61a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[<a name="fr61A">Written</a> at Town-end, Grasmere. Met, and described to me by my sister,
near the quarry at the head of Rydal Lake<a href="#61A"><sup>A</sup></a>, a place still a chosen
resort of vagrants travelling with their families.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">The following are Dorothy Wordsworth's references to this poem in her
Grasmere Journal. They justify the remark of the late Bishop of Lincoln,</span>

  <blockquote>"his poems are sometimes little more than poetical versions of her
  descriptions of the objects which she had seen, <i>and he treated them
  as seen by himself</i>."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">(See <i>Memoirs of Wordsworth</i>, vol. i. pp. 180-1.) </span>

 <blockquote> "Saturday (March 13, 1802).&mdash;William wrote the poem of the Beggar
  Woman, taken from a woman whom I had seen in May (now nearly two years
  ago), when John and he were at Gallow Hill. I sat with him at
  intervals all the morning, and took down his stanzas. After tea I read
  W. the account I had written of the little boy belonging to the tall
  woman: and an unlucky thing it was, for he could not escape from those
  very words, and so he could not write the poem. He left it unfinished,
  and went tired to bed. In our walk from Rydal he had got warmed with
  the subject, and had half cast the poem."<br>
<br>
  "Sunday Morning (March 14). &mdash;William had slept badly. He got up at 9
  o'clock, but before he rose he had finished the Beggar Boy." </blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The following is the "account" written in her <i>Journal</i> on Tuesday, May
23, 1800:</span>

  <blockquote>"A very tall woman, tall much beyond the measure of tall women, called
  at the door. She had on a very long brown cloak, and a very white cap,
  without bonnet. Her face was brown, but it had plainly once been fair.
  She led a little barefooted child about two years old by the hand, and
  said her husband, who was a tinker, was gone before with the other
  children. I gave her a piece of bread. Afterwards, on my road to
  Ambleside, beside the bridge at Rydal, I saw her husband sitting at
  the roadside, his two asses standing beside him, and the two young
  children at play upon the grass. The man did not beg. I passed on, and
  about a quarter of a mile farther I saw two boys before me, one about
  ten, the other about eight years old, at play, chasing a butterfly.
  They were wild figures, not very ragged, but without shoes and
  stockings. The hat of the elder was wreathed round with yellow
  flowers; the younger, whose hat was only a rimless crown, had stuck it
  round with laurel leaves. They continued at play till I drew very
  near, and then they addressed me with the begging cant and the whining
  voice of sorrow. I said, 'I served your mother this morning' (the boys
  were so like the woman who had called at our door that I could not be
  mistaken). 'O,' says the elder, 'you could not serve my mother, for
  she's dead, and my father's in at the next town; he's a potter.' I
  persisted in my assertion, and that I would give them nothing. Says
  the elder, 'Come, let's away,' and away they flew like lightning. They
  had, however, sauntered so long in their road that they did not reach
  Ambleside before me, and I saw them go up to Mathew Harrison's house
  with their wallet upon the elder's shoulder, and creeping with a
  beggar's complaining foot. On my return through Ambleside I met, in
  the street, the mother driving her asses, in the two panniers of one
  of which were the two little children, whom she was chiding and
  threatening with a wand with which she used to drive on her asses,
  while the little things hung in wantonness over the pannier's edge.
  The woman had told me in the morning that she was of Scotland, which
  her accent fully proved, and that she had lived (I think at Wigtown);
  that they could not keep a house, and so they travelled."</blockquote>

<td>She had a tall man's height or more;<br>
Her face from summer's noontide heat<br>
No bonnet shaded, but she wore<br>
A mantle, to her very feet<br>
Descending with a graceful flow, <br>
And on her head a cap as white as new-fallen snow.<br><br>

Her skin was of Egyptian brown:<br>
Haughty, as if her eye had seen<br>
Its own light to a distance thrown,<br>
She towered, fit person for a Queen<br>
To lead those ancient Amazonian files;<br>
Or ruling Bandit's wife among the Grecian isles.<br><br>

Advancing, forth she stretched her hand<br>
And begged an alms with doleful plea<br>
That ceased not; on our English land <br>
Such woes, I knew, could never be;<br>
And yet a boon I gave her, for the creature<br>
Was beautiful to see&mdash;a weed of glorious feature.<br><br>

I left her, and pursued my way;<br>
And soon before me did espy <br>
A pair of little Boys at play,<br>
Chasing a crimson butterfly;<br>
The taller followed with his hat in hand,<br>
Wreathed round with yellow flowers the gayest of the land.<br><br>

The other wore a rimless crown <br>
With leaves of laurel stuck about;<br>
And, while both followed up and down,<br>
Each whooping with a merry shout,<br>
In their fraternal features I could trace<br>
Unquestionable lines of that wild Suppliant's face. <br><br>

Yet <i>they</i>, so blithe of heart, seemed fit<br>
For finest tasks of earth or air:<br>
Wings let them have, and they might flit<br>
Precursors to Aurora's car,<br>
Scattering fresh flowers; though happier far, I ween, <br>
To hunt their fluttering game o'er rock and level green.<br><br>

They dart across my path&mdash;but lo, <br>
Each ready with a plaintive whine!<br>
Said I, "not half an hour ago<br>
Your Mother has had alms of mine."<br>
"That cannot be," one answered&mdash;"she is dead:"&mdash;<br>
I looked reproof&mdash;they saw&mdash;but neither hung his head.<br><br>

"She has been dead, Sir, many a day."&mdash;<br>
"Hush, boys! you're telling me a lie;<br>
It was your Mother, as I say!"<br>
And, in the twinkling of an eye,<br>
"Come! come!" cried one, and without more ado,<br>
Off to some other play the joyous Vagrants flew!<br>

Destined, whate'er their earthly doom,<br>

<a name="63n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp;<span style="color: #555555;"> The text of this poem was never changed. It refers to days
of childhood spent at Cockermouth before 1778. "My sister
Emmeline" is Dorothy Wordsworth. In her <i>Grasmere Journal,</i>
of Sunday, March 14, 1802, the following occurs:</span>

  <blockquote>"While we were at breakfast he" (William) "wrote the poem <i>To a
  Butterfly</i>. He ate not a morsel, but sate with his shirt neck
  unbuttoned, and his waistcoat open when he did it. The thought first
  came upon him as we were talking about the pleasure we both always
  felt at the sight of a butterfly. I told him that I used to chase them
  a little, but that I was afraid of brushing the dust off their wings,
  and did not catch them. He told me how he used to kill all the white
  ones when he went to school, because they were Frenchmen. Mr. Simpson
  came in just as he was finishing the poem. After he was gone, I wrote
  it down, and the other poems, and I read them all over to him....
  William began to try to alter <i>The Butterfly</i>, and tired
  himself."</blockquote>

<h2><a name="section64"></a>The Emigrant Mother</h2>

<h4>Composed March 16th and 17th, 1802.&mdash;Published 1807</h4>

<a href="#section64a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[Suggested by what I have noticed in more than one French fugitive
during the time of the French Revolution. If I am not mistaken the lines
were composed at Sockburn when I was on a visit to Mary and her
brothers.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">In the editions of 1807 and 1815, this poem had no distinctive title;
but in the Wordsworth circle, it was known from the year 1802 as <i>The
Emigrant Mother</i>, and at least one copy was transcribed with this
title in 1802. It was first published under that name in 1820. It was
revised and altered in 1820, 1827, 1832, 1836, and more especially in
1845.<br>
<br>
In Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal the following entries occur:</span>

 <blockquote> "Tuesday (March 16).&mdash;William went up into the orchard, and wrote a
  part of <i>The Emigrant Mother</i>."<br>
<br>
  "Wednesday.&mdash;William went up into the orchard, and finished the
  poem.... I went and sate with W., and walked backwards and forwards in
  the orchard till dinner-time. He read me his poem."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">This poem was included among those "founded on the Affections."&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<td>O blithe New-comer! I have heard,<br>
I hear thee and rejoice.<br>
O Cuckoo! shall I call thee Bird,<br>
Or but a wandering Voice?<br><br>

While I am lying on the grass<br>
Thy twofold shout I hear,<br>
From hill to hill it seems to pass,<br>
At once far off, and near.<br><br>

Though babbling only to the Vale,<br>
Of sunshine and of flowers,<br>
Thou bringest unto me a tale<br>
Of visionary hours.<br><br>

Thrice welcome, darling of the Spring!<br>
Even yet thou art to me<br>
No bird, but an invisible thing,<br>
A voice, a mystery;<br><br>

The same whom in my school-boy days<br>
I listened to; that Cry<br>
Which made me look a thousand ways<br>
In bush, and tree, and sky.<br><br>

To seek thee did I often rove<br>
Through woods and on the green;<br>
And thou wert still a hope, a love;<br>
Still longed for, never seen.<br><br>

And I can listen to thee yet;<br>
Can lie upon the plain<br>
And listen, till I do beget<br>
That golden time again.<br><br>

O blessed Bird! the earth we pace<br>
Again appears to be<br>
An unsubstantial, faery place;<br>
That is fit home for Thee!<br>

<br>
<a name="65n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">In the chronological lists of his poems, published in 1815 and 1820,
Wordsworth left a blank opposite this one, in the column containing the
year of composition. From 1836 to 1849, the date assigned by him was
1804. But in Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Journal</i> the following occurs under
date Tuesday, 22nd March 1802:</span>

 <blockquote> "A mild morning. William worked at the Cuckoo poem.... At the closing
  in of day, went to sit in the orchard. William came to me, and walked
  backwards and forwards. W. repeated the poem to me. I left him there;
  and in 20 minutes he came in, rather tired with attempting to write."<br>
<br>
  "Friday (March 25).&mdash;A beautiful morning. William worked at <i>The
  Cuckoo</i>." </blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">It is therefore evident that it belongs to the year 1802; although it
may have been altered and readjusted in 1804. The connection of the
seventh stanza of this poem with the first of that which follows it, "My
heart leaps up," etc., and of both with the <i>Ode, Intimations of
Immortality</i> (vol. viii.), is obvious.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

 <blockquote> "March 26, 1802.&mdash;While I was getting into bed he" (W.) "wrote <i>The
  Rainbow.</i>"<br>
<br>
  "May 14th.&mdash; ... William very nervous. After he was in bed, haunted
  with altering <i>The Rainbow.</i>"</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">(Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Grasmere Journal</i>.) This poem was known familiarly
in the household as "The Rainbow," although not printed under that
title. The text was never changed.<br>
<br>
In <i>The Friend</i>, vol. i. p. 58 (ed. 1818), Coleridge writes: </span>

  <blockquote>"Men laugh at the falsehoods imposed on them during their childhood,
  because they are not good and wise enough to contemplate the past in
  the present, and so to produce that continuity in their
  self-consciousness, which Nature has made the law of their animal
  life. Men are ungrateful to others, only when they have ceased to look
  back on their former selves with joy and tenderness. They exist in
  fragments." </blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">He then quotes the above poem, and adds:</span>

 <blockquote> "I am informed that these lines have been cited as a specimen of
  despicable puerility. So much the worse for the citer; not willingly
  in <i>his</i> presence would I behold the sun setting behind our
  mountains.... But let the dead bury their dead! The poet sang for the
  living.... I was always pleased with the motto placed under the figure
  of the rosemary in old herbals:

   <blockquote> 'Sus, apage! Haud tibi spiro.'"</blockquote></blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Compare the passage in <i>The Excursion</i> (book ix. l. 36) beginning:</span>

  <blockquote>'... Ah! why in age<br>
  Do we revert so fondly, etc.'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">also that in <i>The Prelude</i> (book v. l. 507) beginning:</span>

 <blockquote> 'Our childhood sits.'</blockquote><br>

<a name="67n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">The text of this poem was never altered. It was not "written in March"
(as the title states), but on the 16th of April (Good Friday) 1802. The
bridge referred to crosses Goldrill Beck, a little below Hartsop in
Patterdale. The following, from Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Journal</i>, records
the walk from Ullswater, over Kirkstone Pass, to Ambleside:</span>

  <blockquote>"Friday, 16th April (Good Friday).&mdash;... When we came to the foot of
  Brothers Water, I left William sitting on the bridge, and went along
  the path on the right side of the lake through the wood. I was
  delighted with what I saw: the water under the boughs of the bare old
  trees, the simplicity of the mountains, and the exquisite beauty of
  the path. There was one grey cottage. I repeated <i>The Glowworm</i> as I
  walked along. I hung over the gate, and thought I could have stayed
  for ever. When I returned, I found William writing a poem descriptive
  of the sights and sounds we saw and heard. There was the gentle
  flowing of the stream, the glittering lively lake, green fields,
  without a living creature to be seen on them; behind us, a flat
  pasture with forty-two cattle feeding; to our left, the road leading
  to the hamlet. No smoke there, the sun shone on the bare roofs. The
  people were at work, ploughing, harrowing, and sowing; lasses working;
  a dog barking now and then; cocks crowing, birds twittering; the snow
  in patches at the top of the highest hills; yellow palms, purple and
  green twigs on the birches, ashes with their glittering stems quite
  bare. The hawthorn a bright green, with black stems under the oak. The
  moss of the oaks glossy.... As we went up the vale of Brothers Water,
  more and more cattle feeding, a hundred of them. William finished his
  poem before we got to the foot of Kirkstone. There were hundreds of
  cattle in the vale.... The walk up Kirkstone was very interesting. The
  becks among the rocks were all alive. William shewed me the little
  mossy streamlet which he had before loved, when he saw its bright
  green track in the snow. The view above Ambleside very beautiful.
  There we sate, and looked down on the green vale. We watched the crows
  at a little distance from us become white as silver, as they flew in
  the sunshine; and, when they went still farther, they looked like
  shapes of water passing over the green fields."</blockquote>

<h2><a name="section68"></a>The Redbreast chasing the Butterfly<a href="#68A"><span style="font-size: 70%;"><sup>A</sup></span></a></h2>

<h4>Composed April 18, 1802.&mdash;Published 1807</h4>

<a href="#section68a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[Observed, as described, in the then beautiful orchard,
Town-end, Grasmere.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">Included among the "Poems of the Fancy."<br>
<br>
In some editions this poem is assigned to the year 1806;
but, in Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Journal</i> the following occurs, under
date "Sunday, 18th" (April 1802):</span>

  <blockquote>"A mild grey morning with rising vapours. We sate in the orchard.
  William wrote the poem on the Robin and the Butterfly.... W. met me at
  Rydal with the conclusion of the poem to the Robin. I read it to him
  in bed. We left out some lines."</blockquote>

<td>Art thou the bird whom Man loves best,<br>
The pious bird with the scarlet breast,<br>
  Our little English Robin;<br>
The bird that comes about our doors<br>
When Autumn-winds are sobbing?<br>
Art thou the Peter of Norway Boors?<br>
  Their Thomas in Finland,<br>
  And Russia far inland?<br>
The bird, that by some name or other<br>
All men who know thee call their brother,<br>
The darling of children and men?<br>
Could Father Adam open his eyes<br>
And see this sight beneath the skies,<br>
He'd wish to close them again.<br>
&mdash;If the Butterfly knew but his friend,<br>
Hither his flight he would bend;<br>
And find his way to me,<br>
Under the branches of the tree:<br>
In and out, he darts about;<br>
Can this be the bird, to man so good,<br>
That, after their bewildering,<br>
Covered with leaves the little children,<br>
  So painfully in the wood?<br><br>

What ailed thee, Robin, that thou could'st pursue<br>
  A beautiful creature,<br>
That is gentle by nature?<br>
Beneath the summer sky<br>
From flower to flower let him fly;<br>
'Tis all that he wishes to do.<br>
The cheerer Thou of our in-door sadness,<br>
He is the friend of our summer gladness:<br>
What hinders, then, that ye should be<br>
Playmates in the sunny weather,<br>
And fly about in the air together!<br>
His beautiful wings in crimson are drest,<br>
A crimson as bright as thine own:<br>
Would'st thou be happy in thy nest,<br>
O pious Bird! whom man loves best,<br>
Love him, or leave him alone!<br>

In her <i>Journal</i>, April 20, 1802, Dorothy Wordsworth

  <blockquote>"William wrote a conclusion to the poem of <i>The Butterfly</i>, 'I've
  watch'd you now a full half-hour.'"</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">This, and the structure of the two poems, makes it probable that the

283); but they were always printed as separate poems.<br>
<br>
Many of the "flowers" in the orchard at Dove Cottage were planted by
Dorothy Wordsworth, and some of the "trees" by William. The "summer
days" of childhood are referred to in <a href="#section63">the previous poem</a>, <i>To a
Butterfly</i>, written on the 14th of March 1802.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<a name="70n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">The full title of this poem, in the editions of 1807 to 1832, was
<i>Foresight, or the Charge of a Child to his younger Companion</i>, but it
was originally known in the household as "Children gathering Flowers."
The shortened title was adopted in 1836. The following is from Dorothy
Wordsworth's <i>Journal:</i></span>

  <blockquote>"Wednesday, 28th April (1802).&mdash;Copied the <i>Prioress's Tale</i>. William
  was in the orchard. I went to him; he worked away at his poem, though
  he was ill, and tired. I happened to say that when I was a child I
  would not have pulled a strawberry blossom; I left him, and wrote out
  the <i>Manciple's Tale</i>. At dinner time he came in with the poem of
  <i>Children gathering Flowers,</i> but it was not quite finished, and it
  kept him long from his dinner. It is now done. He is working at <i>The
  Tinker.</i>"</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">At an earlier date in the same year,&mdash;Jan. 31st, 1802,&mdash;the following
occurs:</span>

  <blockquote>"I found a strawberry blossom in a rock. The little slender flower had
  more courage than the green leaves, for <i>they</i> were but half expanded
  and half grown, but the blossom was spread full out. I uprooted it
  rashly, and I felt as if I had been committing an outrage; so I
  planted it again. It will have but a stormy life of it, but let it
  live if it can."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">With this poem compare a parallel passage in Marvel's <i>The Picture of T.
C. in a Prospect of Flowers</i>:</span>

 <blockquote> 'But oh, young beauty of the woods,<br>
  Whom nature courts with fruits and flowers,<br>
  Gather the flowers, but spare the buds;<br>
  Lest Flora, angry at thy crime<br>
  To kill her infants in their prime,<br>
  Should quickly make the example yours;<br>
  And, ere we see,<br>
  Nip in the blossom all our hopes in thee.'    </blockquote>

<h4>Composed April 30, 1802.&mdash;Published 1807</h4>

<a href="#section71a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[Written at Town-end, Grasmere. It is remarkable that this flower,
coming out so early in the spring as it does, and so bright and
beautiful, and in such profusion, should not have been noticed earlier
in English verse. What adds much to the interest that attends it is its
habit of shutting itself up and opening out according to the degree of
light and temperature of the air.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">One of the "Poems of the Fancy." In the original MS. this poem is called
<i>To the lesser Celandine</i>, but in the proof "small" was substituted for
"lesser."<br>
<br>
In Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Journal</i> the following occurs, under date April
30, 1802:</span>

  <blockquote>"We came into the orchard directly after breakfast, and sat there. The
  lake was calm, the sky cloudy. William began to write the poem of <i>The
  Celandine</i>.... I walked backwards and forwards with William. He
  repeated his poem to me, then he got to work again, and would not give
  over."</blockquote>

<td>Pansies, lilies, kingcups, daisies,<br>
Let them live upon their praises;<br>
Long as there's a sun that sets,<br>
Primroses will have their glory;<br>
Long as there are violets,<br>
They will have a place in story:<br>
There's a flower that shall be mine,<br>
'Tis the little Celandine.<br><br>

Eyes of some men travel far<br>
For the finding of a star;<br>
Up and down the heavens they go,<br>
Men that keep a mighty rout!<br>
I'm as great as they, I trow,<br>
Since the day I found thee out,<br>
Little Flower!&mdash;I'll make a stir,<br>
Like a sage astronomer.<br><br>

Modest, yet withal an Elf<br>
Bold, and lavish of thyself;<br>
Since we needs must first have met<br>
I have seen thee, high and low,<br>
Thirty years or more, and yet<br>
'Twas a face I did not know;<br>
Thou hast now, go where I may,<br>
Fifty greetings in a day.<br><br>

Ere a leaf is on a bush,<br>
In the time before the thrush<br>
Has a thought about her nest,<br>
Thou wilt come with half a call,<br>
Spreading out thy glossy breast<br>
Like a careless Prodigal;<br>
Telling tales about the sun,<br>
When we've little warmth, or none.<br><br>

Poets, vain men in their mood!<br>
Travel with the multitude:<br>
Never heed them; I aver<br>
That they all are wanton wooers;<br>
But the thrifty cottager,<br>
Who stirs little out of doors,<br>
Joys to spy thee near her home;<br>
Spring is coming, Thou art come!<br>
<br>
Comfort have thou of thy merit,<br>
Kindly, unassuming Spirit!<br>
Careless of thy neighbourhood,<br>
Thou dost show thy pleasant face<br>
On the moor, and in the wood,<br>
In the lane;&mdash;there's not a place,<br>
Howsoever mean it be,<br>
But 'tis good enough for thee.<br><br>

Ill befal the yellow flowers,<br>
Children of the flaring hours!<br>
Buttercups, that will be seen,<br>
Whether we will see or no;<br>
Others, too, of lofty mien;<br>
They have done as worldlings do,<br>
Taken praise that should be thine,<br>
Little, humble Celandine!<br><br>

Prophet of delight and mirth,<br>
Ill-requited upon earth;<br>
Herald of a mighty band,<br>
Of a joyous train ensuing,<br>
Serving at my heart's command,<br>
Tasks that are no tasks renewing,<br>
I will sing, as doth behove,<br>
Hymns in praise of what I love!<br>

<td>Pleasures newly found are sweet<br>
When they lie about our feet:<br>
February last, my heart<br>
First at sight of thee was glad;<br>
All unheard of as thou art,<br>
Thou must needs, I think, have had,<br>
Celandine! and long ago,<br>
Praise of which I nothing know.<br><br>

I have not a doubt but he,<br>
Whosoe'er the man might be,<br>
Who the first with pointed rays<br>
(Workman worthy to be sainted)<br>
Set the sign-board in a blaze,<br>
When the rising sun he painted,<br>
Took the fancy from a glance<br>
At thy glittering countenance.<br><br>

Soon as gentle breezes bring<br>
News of winter's vanishing,<br>
And the children build their bowers,<br>
Sticking 'kerchief-plots of mould<br>
All about with full-blown flowers,<br>
Thick as sheep in shepherd's fold!<br>
With the proudest thou art there,<br>
Mantling in the tiny square.<br><br>

Often have I sighed to measure<br>
By myself a lonely pleasure,<br>
Sighed to think, I read a book<br>
Only read, perhaps, by me;<br>
Yet I long could overlook<br>
Thy bright coronet and Thee,<br>
And thy arch and wily ways,<br>
And thy store of other praise.<br><br>

Blithe of heart, from week to week<br>
Thou dost play at hide-and-seek;<br>
While the patient primrose sits<br>
Like a beggar in the cold,<br>
Thou, a flower of wiser wits,<br>
Slip'st into thy sheltering hold;<br>
Liveliest of the vernal train<br>
When ye all are out again.<br><br>

Drawn by what peculiar spell,<br>
By what charm of sight or smell,<br>
Does the dim-eyed curious Bee,<br>
Labouring for her waxen cells,<br>
Fondly settle upon Thee<br>
Prized above all buds and bells<br>
Opening daily at thy side,<br>
By the season multiplied?<br><br>

Thou art not beyond the moon,<br>
But a thing "beneath our shoon:"<br>
Let the bold Discoverer thrid<br>
In his bark the polar sea;<br>
Rear who will a pyramid;<br>
Praise it is enough for me,<br>
If there be but three or four<br>
Who will love my little Flower.<br>

<td>Within our happy Castle there dwelt One<br>
Whom without blame I may not overlook;<br>
For never sun on living creature shone<br>
Who more devout enjoyment with us took:<br>
Here on his hours he hung as on a book,<br>
On his own time here would he float away,<br>
As doth a fly upon a summer brook;<br>
But go to-morrow, or belike to-day,<br>
Seek for him,&mdash;he is fled; and whither none can say.<br><br>

Thus often would he leave our peaceful home,<br>
And find elsewhere his business or delight;<br>
Out of our Valley's limits did he roam:<br>
Full many a time, upon a stormy night,<br>
His voice came to us from the neighbouring height:<br>
Oft could we see him driving full in view<br>
At midday when the sun was shining bright;<br>
What ill was on him, what he had to do,<br>
A mighty wonder bred among our quiet crew.<br><br>

Ah! piteous sight it was to see this Man<br>
When he came back to us, a withered flower,&mdash;<br>
Or like a sinful creature, pale and wan.<br>
Down would he sit; and without strength or power<br>
Look at the common grass from hour to hour:<br>
And oftentimes, how long I fear to say,<br>
Where apple-trees in blossom made a bower,<br>
Retired in that sunshiny shade he lay;<br>
And, like a naked Indian, slept himself away.<br><br>

Great wonder to our gentle tribe it was<br>
Whenever from our Valley he withdrew;<br>
For happier soul no living creature has<br>
Than he had, being here the long day through.<br>
Some thought he was a lover, and did woo:<br>
Some thought far worse of him, and judged him wrong;<br>
But verse was what he had been wedded to;<br>
And his own mind did like a tempest strong <br>
Come to him thus, and drove the weary Wight along.<br><br>

With him there often walked in friendly guise,<br>
Or lay upon the moss by brook or tree,<br>
A noticeable Man with large grey eyes,<br>
And a pale face that seemed undoubtedly<br>
As if a blooming face it ought to be;<br>
Heavy his low-hung lip did oft appear,<br>
Deprest by weight of musing Phantasy;<br>
Profound his forehead was, though not severe;<br>
Yet some did think that he had little business here:<br><br>

Sweet heaven forefend! his was a lawful right;<br>
Noisy he was, and gamesome as a boy;<br>
His limbs would toss about him with delight<br>
Like branches when strong winds the trees annoy.<br>
Nor lacked his calmer hours device or toy<br>
To banish listlessness and irksome care;<br>
He would have taught you how you might employ<br>
Yourself; and many did to him repair,&mdash;<br>
And certes not in vain; he had inventions rare.<br><br>

Expedients, too, of simplest sort he tried:<br>
Long blades of grass, plucked round him as he lay,<br>
Made, to his ear attentively applied,<br>
A pipe on which the wind would deftly play;<br>
Glasses he had, that little things display,<br>
The beetle panoplied in gems and gold,<br>
A mailed angel on a battle-day;<br>
The mysteries that cups of flowers enfold,<br>
And all the gorgeous sights which fairies do behold.<br><br>

He would entice that other Man to hear<br>
His music, and to view his imagery:<br>
And, sooth, these two were each to the other dear:<br>
No livelier love in such a place could be:<br>
There did they dwell-from earthly labour free,<br>
As happy spirits as were ever seen;<br>
If but a bird, to keep them company,<br>
Or butterfly sate down, they were, I ween,<br>
As pleased as if the same had been a Maiden-queen.<br>

<a name="73n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">There can now be no doubt that, in the first four of these <i>Stanzas</i>,
Wordsworth refers to himself; and that, in the last four, he refers to
Coleridge. For a time it was uncertain whether in the earlier stanzas he
had Coleridge, or himself, in view; and whether, in the later ones, some
one else was, or was not, described. De Quincey, quoting (as he often
did) in random fashion, mixes up extracts from each set of the stanzas,
and applies them both to Coleridge; and Dorothy Wordsworth, in her
<i>Journal</i>, gives apparent (though only apparent) sanction to a reverse
order of allusion, by writing of "the stanzas about C. and himself" (her
brother). The following are her references to the poem in that <i>Journal:</i></span>

  <blockquote>"9th May (1802).-After tea he (W.) wrote two stanzas in the manner of
  Thomson's <i>Castle of Indolence</i>, and was tired out.<br>
<br>
  "10th May.&mdash;William still at work, though it is past ten o'clock ...
  William did not sleep till three o'clock."<br>
<br>
  "11th May.&mdash;William finished the stanzas about C. and himself. He did
  not go out to-day. ... He completely finished his poem. He went to bed
  at twelve o'clock." </blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">From these extracts two things are evident, </span>
<ol type="1">

  <li>who the persons are described in the stanzas, and </li>

  <li>the immense labour bestowed upon the poem.</li>
</ol>

<span style="color: #555555;">In the <i>Memoirs of Wordsworth</i>, by the late Bishop of Lincoln, there is
a passage (vol. ii. chap. li. p. 309) amongst the "Personal
Reminiscences, 1836," in which the Hon. Mr. Justice Coleridge virtually
decides the question of the identity of the two persons referred to, in
his record of a conversation with the poet. It is as follows:</span>

  <blockquote>"October 10th.&mdash;I have passed a great many hours to-day with
  Wordsworth in his home. I stumbled on him with proof sheets before
  him. He read me nearly all the sweet stanzas written in his copy of
  the <i>Castle of Indolence</i>, describing himself and my uncle; and he and
  Mrs. W. both assured me the description of the latter at that time was
  perfectly accurate; and he was almost as a great boy in feelings, and
  had all the tricks and fancies there described. Mrs. W. seemed to look
  back on him, and those times, with the fondest affection."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">I think "the neighbouring height" referred to is the height of White
Moss Common, behind the Fir-Grove, where Wordsworth was often heard
murmuring out his verses," booing" as the country folks said: and the</span>

   <blockquote> 'driving full in view<br>
  At midday when the sun was shining bright,'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">aptly describes his habits as recorded in his sister's <i>Journal</i>, and
elsewhere. The "withered flower," the "creature pale and wan," are
significant of those terrible reactions of spirit, which followed his
joyous hours of insight and inspiration. Stanzas IV. to VII. of
<i>Resolution and Independence</i> (p. 314), in which Wordsworth undoubtedly
described himself, may be compared with stanza III. of this poem. The
lines</span>

 <blockquote> 'Down would he sit; and without strength or power<br>
  Look at the common grass from hour to hour,'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">are aptly illustrated by such passages in his sister's <i>Journal</i>, as the
following, of 29th April 1802:</span>

  <blockquote>"We went to John's Grove, sate a while at first; afterwards William
  lay, and I lay in the trench, under the fence&mdash;he with his eyes
  closed, and listening to the waterfalls and the birds. There was no
  one waterfall above another&mdash;it was a kind of water in the air&mdash;the
  voice of the air. We were unseen by one another."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Again, April 23rd,</span>

 <blockquote> "Coleridge and I pushed on before. We left William sitting on the
  stones, feasting with silence."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">And this recalls the first verse of <i>Expostulation and Reply</i>, written
at Alfoxden in 1798;</span>

  <blockquote>Why, William, on that old grey stone,<br>
  Thus for the length of half a day,<br>
  Why, William, sit you thus alone,<br>
  And dream your time away?'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The retreat where "apple-trees in blossom made a bower," and where he so
often "slept himself away," was evidently the same as that described in
the poem <i>The Green Linnet</i>:</span>

  <blockquote>'Beneath these fruit-tree boughs that shed<br>
  Their snow white blossoms on my head.'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">On the other hand, the "low-hung lip" and "profound" forehead of the
other, the "noticeable Man with large grey eyes," mark him out as S. T.
C.; "the rapt One, of the god-like forehead," described in the
<i>Extempore Effusion upon the Death of James Hogg</i>. The description
"Noisy he was, and gamesome as a boy," is verified by what the poet and
his wife said to Mr. Justice Coleridge in 1836. In addition, Mr.
Hutchinson of Kimbolton tells me he "often heard his father say that
Coleridge was uproarious in his mirth."<br>
<br>
Matthew Arnold wrote me an interesting letter some years ago about these
stanzas, from which I make the following extract:</span>

 <blockquote> "When one looks uneasily at a poem it is easy to fidget oneself
  further, and neither the Wordsworth nor the Coleridge of our common
  notions seem to be exactly hit off in the <i>Stanzas</i>; still, I believe
  that the first described is Wordsworth and that the second described
  is Coleridge. I have myself heard Wordsworth speak of his prolonged
  exhausting wanderings among the hills. Then Miss Fenwick's notes show
  that Coleridge is certainly one of the two personages of the poem, and
  there are points in the description of the second man which suit him
  very well. The <i>profound forehead</i> is a touch akin to the <i>god-like
  forehead</i> in the mention of Coleridge in a later poem.<br>
<br>
  "I have a sort of recollection of having heard something about the
  <i>inventions rare,</i> and Coleridge is certain to have dabbled, at one
  time or other, in natural philosophy."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">In 1796 Coleridge wrote to his friend Cottle from Nether Stowey:</span>
  
 <blockquote> " ... I should not think of devoting less than 20 years to an Epic
  Poem: ten to collect materials and warm my mind with universal
  science. I would be a tolerable Mathematician, I would thoroughly know
  Mechanics, Hydrostatics, Optics, and Astronomy, Botany, Metallurgy,
  Fossilism, Chemistry, Geology, Anatomy, Medicine&mdash;then the <i>mind of
  man</i>&mdash;then the <i>minds of men</i>&mdash;in all Travels, Voyages, and Histories.
  So I would spend ten years&mdash;the next five to the composition of the
  poem&mdash;and the last five to the correction of it. So would I write,
  haply not unhearing of the divine and rightly whispering Voice," etc.</blockquote>

Mr. T. Hutchinson (Dublin) writes in <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i>, Dec. 15, 1894:

  <blockquote>"I take it for granted these lines were written, not only on the
  fly-leaf of Wordsworth's copy of the <i>Castle of Indolence</i>, but also
  by way of Supplement to that poem; i. e. as an <i>addendum</i> to the
  descriptive list of the denizens of the Castle given in stanzas
  LVII-LXIX of Canto I.; that, in short, they are meant to be read as
  though they were an after-thought of James Thomson's. Their author,
  therefore, has rightly imparted to them the curiously blended flavour
  of <i>romantic melancholy and slippered mirth,</i> of dreamlike vagueness
  and smiling hyperbole, which forms the distinctive mark of Thomson's
  poem; and thus the Poet and the Philosopher-Friend of Wordsworth's
  stanzas, like Thomson's companion sketches of the splenetic Solitary,
  the <i>bard more fat than bard beseems,</i> and the <i>little, round, fat,
  oily Man of God,</i> are neither more nor less than gentle caricatures."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">It has been suggested by Coleridge's grandson that Wordsworth was
describing S. T. C. in all the stanzas of this poem; that he drew two
separate pictures of him; in the first four stanzas a realistic
"character portrait," and in the last four a "companion picture,
figuring the outward semblance of Coleridge, but embodying
characteristics drawn from a third person"; so that we have a "fancy
sketch" mixed up with a real one. I cannot agree with this.  The
evidence against it is</span>
<ol type="1">
  <li>Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal; </li>
<li>  the poet's and his wife's remarks to Mr. Justice Coleridge; </li>
<li>  the fact that Wordsworth was not in the habit of "passing from
  realism into artistic composition," except where he distinctly
  indicated it, as in the case of the Hawkshead Schoolmaster, in the
  "Matthew" poems.  Such composite or conglomerate work was quite
  foreign to Wordsworth's genius.</li>

<h4>Begun May 3, finished July 4, 1802.&mdash;Published 1807</h4>

<a href="#section74a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[Written at Town-end, Grasmere. This old man I met a few hundred yards
from my cottage; and the account of him is taken from his own mouth. I
was in the state of feeling described in the beginning of the poem,
while crossing over Barton Fell from Mr. Clarkson's, at the foot of
Ullswater, towards Askham. The image of the hare I then observed on the
ridge of the Fell.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">This poem was known in the Wordsworth household as "The Leech-Gatherer,"
although it never received that name in print. An entry in Dorothy
Wordsworth's <i>Journal</i> of Friday, 3rd October 1800, may preface what she
wrote in 1802 about the composition of the poem.</span>

 <blockquote> "When William and I returned from accompanying Jones, we met an old
  man almost double. He had on a coat thrown over his shoulders above
  his waistcoat and coat. Under this he carried a bundle, and had an
  apron on, and a night-cap. His face was interesting. He had dark eyes,
  and a long nose. John, who afterwards met him at Wytheburn, took him
  for a Jew. He was of Scotch parents, but had been born in the army. He
  had had a wife, 'and a good woman, and it pleased God to bless him
  with ten children.' All these were dead but one, of whom he had not
  heard for many years, a sailor. His trade was to gather leeches; but
  now leeches were scarce, and he had not strength for it. He lived by
  begging, and was making his way to Carlisle where he would buy a few
  books to sell. He said leeches were very scarce, partly owing to this
  dry season; but many years they had been scarce. He supposed it was
  owing to their being much sought after; that they did not breed fast;
  and were of slow growth. Leeches were formerly 2s. 6d. the 100; now
  they were 30s. He had been hurt in driving a cart, his leg broken, his
  body driven over, his skull fractured. He felt no pain till he
  recovered from his first insensibility. It was late in the evening,
  when the light was just going away."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">It is most likely that this walk of William and Dorothy Wordsworth
"accompanying Jones," was on the day of Jones's departure from Dove
Cottage, viz. 26th September.<br>
<br>
The <i>Journal</i> continues:</span>

  <blockquote>"Tuesday, 4th May, 1802.&mdash;Though William went to bed nervous and jaded
  in the extreme, he rose refreshed. I wrote out <i>The Leech-Gatherer</i>
  for him, which he had begun the night before, and of which he wrote
  several stanzas in bed this morning...."<br>
<br>
  (They started to walk up the Raise to Wytheburn.)<br>
<br>
  "It was very hot; we rested several times by the way, read, and
  repeated <i>The Leech-Gatherer.</i>"<br>
<br>
  "Friday, 7th May.&mdash;William had slept uncommonly well, so, feeling
  himself strong, he fell to work at <i>The Leech-Gatherer</i>; he wrote hard
  at it till dinner time, then he gave over, tired to death&mdash;he had
  finished the poem."<br>
<br>
  "Sunday morning, 9th May.&mdash;William worked at <i>The Leech-Gatherer</i>
  almost incessantly from morning till tea-time. I copied <i>The
  Leech-Gatherer</i> and other poems for Coleridge. I was oppressed and
  sick at heart, for he wearied himself to death."<br>
<br>
  "Sunday, 4th July.&mdash;... William finished <i>The Leech-Gatherer</i> to-day."<br>
<br>
  "Monday, 5th July.&mdash;I copied out <i>The Leech-Gatherer</i> for Coleridge,
  and for us."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">From these extracts it is clear that Dorothy Wordsworth considered the
poem as "finished" on the 7th of May, and on the 9th she sent a copy to
Coleridge; but that it was not till the 4th of July that it was really
finished, and then a second copy was forwarded to Coleridge. It is
impossible to say from which of the two MSS. sent to him Coleridge
transcribed the copy which he forwarded to Sir George Beaumont. From
that copy of a copy (which is now amongst the Beaumont MSS. at
Coleorton) the various readings given, on Coleridge's authority, in the
notes to the poem, were obtained some years ago.<br>
<br>
The Fenwick note to the poem illustrates Wordsworth's habit of blending
in one description details which were originally separate, both as to
time and place. The scenery and the incidents of the poem are alike
composite. As he tells us that he met the leech-gatherer a few hundred
yards from Dove Cottage, the "lonely place" with its "pool, bare to the
eye of heaven," at once suggests White Moss Common and its small tarn;
but he adds that, in the opening stanzas of the poem, he is describing a
state of feeling he was in, when crossing the fells at the foot of
Ullswater to Askam, and that the image of the hare "running races in her
mirth," with the glittering mist accompanying her, was observed by him,
not on White Moss Common, but in one of the ridges of Moor Divock. To H.
C. Robinson he said of the "Leech-Gatherer" (Sept. 10, 1816), that "he
gave to his poetic character powers of mind which his original did not
possess." (Robinson's <i>Diary</i>, etc., vol. ii. p. 24.)<br>

Over his own sweet voice the Stock-dove broods;<br>

in writing this stanza. I cannot agree with this. The value and interest

never failed him; and that, when he appears to moralise at his own
expense, he was doing so at Coleridge's. Besides, the date of this poem,
taken in connection with entries in the Grasmere Journal of Dorothy
Wordsworth, makes it all but certain that Coleridge was not referred

which has much interest as bearing on this poem<a href="#74C"><sup>C</sup></a>. The following are
extracts from it:</span>

 <blockquote> "It is not a matter of indifference whether you are pleased with his
  figure and employment, it may be comparatively whether you are pleased
  with <i>this Poem</i>; but it is of the utmost importance that you should
  have had pleasure in contemplating the fortitude, independence,
  persevering spirit, and the general moral dignity of this old man's
  character." Again, "I will explain to you, in prose, my feelings in
  writing <i>that</i> poem.... I describe myself as having been exalted to
  the highest pitch of delight by the joyousness and beauty of nature;
  and then as depressed, even in the midst of those beautiful objects,
  to the lowest dejection and despair. A young poet in the midst of the
  happiness of nature is described as overwhelmed by the thoughts of the
  miserable reverses which have befallen the happiest of all men, viz.
  poets. I think of this till I am so deeply impressed with it, that I
  consider the manner in which I was rescued from my dejection and
  despair almost as an interposition of Providence. A person reading the
  poem with feelings like mine will have been awed and controlled,
  expecting something spiritual or supernatural. What is brought
  forward? A lonely place, 'a pond, by which an old man <i>was</i>, far from
  all house or home:' not <i>stood</i>, nor <i>sat</i>, but <i>was</i>&mdash;the figure
  presented in the most naked simplicity possible. This feeling of
  spirituality or supernaturalness is again referred to as being strong
  in my mind in this passage. How came he here? thought I, or what can
  he be doing? I then describe him, whether ill or well is not for me to
  judge with perfect confidence; but this I <i>can</i> confidently affirm,
  that though I believe God has given me a strong imagination, I cannot
  conceive a figure more impressive than that of an old man like this,
  the survivor of a wife and ten children, travelling alone among the
  mountains and all lonely places, carrying with him his own fortitude
  and the necessities which an unjust state of society has laid upon
  him. You speak of his speech as tedious. Every thing is tedious when
  one does not read with the feelings of the author. <i>The Thorn</i> is
  tedious to hundreds; and so is <i>The Idiot Boy</i> to hundreds. It is in
  the character of the old man to tell his story, which an impatient
  reader must feel tedious. But, good heavens! such a figure, in such a
  place; a pious, self-respecting, miserably infirm and pleased old man
  telling such a tale!"</blockquote>

occasions in these delightful volumes by the poet's nephew, the
reticence as to names&mdash;warrantable perhaps in 1851, so soon after the
poet's death&mdash;has now deprived the world of every means of knowing to
whom many of Wordsworth's letters were addressed. Professor Dowden asks
about it&mdash;and very naturally:</span>

<h4>Composed May 21, 1802.&mdash;Published 1807<a href="#75A"><sup>A</sup></a></h4>

<a href="#section75a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[In the cottage of Town-end, one afternoon in 1801, my sister read to me
the sonnets of Milton. I had long been well acquainted with them, but I
was particularly struck on that occasion with the dignified simplicity
and majestic harmony that runs through most of them&mdash;in character so
totally different from the Italian, and still more so from Shakespeare's
fine sonnets. I took fire, if I may be allowed to say so, and produced
three sonnets the same afternoon, the first I ever wrote, except an
irregular one at school. Of these three the only one I distinctly
remember is 'I grieved for Buonapart&eacute;, etc.'; one of the others was
never written down; the third, which was I believe preserved, I cannot
particularise.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">One of the "Sonnets dedicated to Liberty," afterwards called "Poems
dedicated to National Independence and Liberty." From the edition of
1815 onwards, it bore the title <i>1801</i>.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<h2><a name="section76"></a>A Farewell</h2>

<h4>Composed May 29, 1802.&mdash;Published 1815</h4>

<a href="#section76a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[Composed just before my Sister and I went to fetch Mrs. Wordsworth from
Gallow-hill, near Scarborough.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">This was one of the "Poems founded on the Affections." It was published
in 1815 and in 1820 without a title, but with the sub-title 'Composed in
the Year 1802'. In 1827 and 1832 it was called 'A Farewell', to which
the sub-title was added. The sub-title was omitted in 1836, and
afterwards.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<td>Farewell, thou little Nook of mountain-ground,<br>
Thou rocky corner in the lowest stair<br>
Of that magnificent temple which doth bound<br>
One side of our whole vale with grandeur rare;<br>
Sweet garden-orchard, eminently fair,<br>
The loveliest spot that man hath ever found,<br>
Farewell!&mdash;we leave thee to Heaven's peaceful care,<br>
Thee, and the Cottage which thou dost surround.<br><br>

Our boat is safely anchored by the shore,<br>
And there will safely ride when we are gone;<br>
The flowering shrubs that deck our humble door<br>
Will prosper, though untended and alone:<br>
Fields, goods, and far-off chattels we have none:<br>
These narrow bounds contain our private store<br>
Of things earth makes, and sun doth shine upon;<br>
Here are they in our sight&mdash;we have no more.<br><br>

Sunshine and shower be with you, bud and bell!<br>
For two months now in vain we shall be sought;<br>
We leave you here in solitude to dwell<br>
With these our latest gifts of tender thought;<br>
Thou, like the morning, in thy saffron coat,<br>
Bright gowan, and marsh-marigold, farewell!<br>
Whom from the borders of the Lake we brought,<br>
And placed together near our rocky Well.<br><br>

We go for One to whom ye will be dear;<br>
And she will prize this Bower, this Indian shed,<br>
Our own contrivance, Building without peer!<br>
&mdash;A gentle Maid, whose heart is lowly bred,<br>
Whose pleasures are in wild fields gathered,<br>
With joyousness, and with a thoughtful cheer,<br>
Will come to you; to you herself will wed;<br>
And love the blessed life that we lead here.<br><br>

Dear Spot! which we have watched with tender heed,<br>
Bringing thee chosen plants and blossoms blown<br>
Among the distant mountains, flower and weed,<br>
Which thou hast taken to thee as thy own.<br>
Making all kindness registered and known;<br>
Thou for our sakes, though Nature's child indeed,<br>
Fair in thyself and beautiful alone,<br>
Hast taken gifts which thou dost little need.<br><br>

And O most constant, yet most fickle Place,<br>
That hast thy wayward moods, as thou dost show<br>
To them who look not daily on thy face;<br>
Who, being loved, in love no bounds dost know,<br>
And say'st, when we forsake thee, "Let them go!"<br>
Thou easy-hearted Thing, with thy wild race<br>
Of weeds and flowers, till we return be slow,<br>
And travel with the year at a soft pace.<br><br>

Help us to tell Her tales of years gone by,<br>
And this sweet spring, the best beloved and best;<br>
Joy will be flown in its mortality;<br>
Something must stay to tell us of the rest.<br>
Here, thronged with primroses, the steep rock's breast<br>
Glittered at evening like a starry sky;<br>
And in this bush our sparrow built her nest,<br>
Of which I sang one song that will not die.<br><br>

O happy Garden! whose seclusion deep<br>
Hath been so friendly to industrious hours;<br>
And to soft slumbers, that did gently steep<br>
Our spirits, carrying with them dreams of flowers,<br>
And wild notes warbled among leafy bowers;<br>
Two burning months let summer overleap,<br>
And, coming back with Her who will be ours,<br>
Into thy bosom we again shall creep.<br>

spring. The "bower" is gone; but, where it used to be, a seat is now
erected.<br>

<a name="78n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">The date which Wordsworth gave to this sonnet on its first publication
in 1807, viz. September 3, 1803,&mdash;and which he retained in all
subsequent editions of his works till 1836,&mdash;is inaccurate. He left
London for Dover, on his way to Calais, on the 31st of July 1802. The
sonnet was written that morning as he travelled towards Dover. The
following record of the journey is preserved in his sister's <i>Journal:</i></span>

<blockquote>  "<a name="fr78A">July</a> 30.<a href="#78A"><sup>A</sup></a>&mdash;Left London between five and six o'clock of the morning
  outside the Dover coach. A beautiful morning. The city, St. Paul's,
  with the river&mdash;a multitude of little boats, made a beautiful sight as
  we crossed <i>Westminster Bridge</i>; the houses not overhung by their
  clouds of smoke, and were hung out endlessly; yet the sun shone so
  brightly, with such a pure light, that there was something like the
  purity of one of Nature's own grand spectacles."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">This sonnet underwent no change in successive editions.<br>
<br>
In illustration of it, an anecdote of the late Bishop of St. David's may
be given, as reported by Lord Coleridge.</span>

 <blockquote> "In the great debate on the abolition of the Irish Establishment in
  1869, the Bishop of St. David's, Dr. Thirlwall, had made a very
  remarkable speech, and had been kept till past daybreak in the House
  of Lords, before the division was over, and he was able to walk home.
  He was then an old man, and in failing health. Some time after, he was
  asked whether he had not run some risk to his health, and whether he
  did not feel much exhausted. 'Yes,' he said, 'perhaps so; but I was
  more than repaid by walking out upon Westminster Bridge after the
  division, seeing London in the morning light as Wordsworth saw it, and
  repeating to myself his noble sonnet as I walked home.'"</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">This anecdote was told to the Wordsworth Society, at its meeting on the
3rd of May 1882, after a letter had been read by the Secretary, from Mr.
Robert Spence Watson, recording the following similar experience:</span>

  <blockquote>"... As confirming the perfect truth of Wordsworth's description of
  the external aspects of a scene, and the way in which he reached its
  inmost soul, I may tell you what happened to me, and may have happened
  to many others. Many years ago, I think it was in 1859, I chanced to
  be passing (in a pained and depressed state of mind, occasioned by the
  death of a friend) over Waterloo Bridge at half-past three on a lovely
  June morning. It was broad daylight, and I was alone. Never when alone
  in the remotest recesses of the Alps, with nothing around me but the
  mountains, or upon the plains of Africa, alone with the wonderful
  glory of the southern night, have I seen anything to approach the
  solemnity&mdash;the soothing solemnity&mdash;of the city, sleeping under the
  early sun:

   <blockquote> 'Earth has not any thing to show more fair.'</blockquote>

  "How simply, yet how perfectly, Wordsworth has interpreted it! It was
  a happy thing for us that the Dover coach left at so untimely an hour.
  It was this sonnet, I think, that first opened my eyes to Wordsworth's
  greatness as a poet. Perhaps nothing that he has written shows more
  strikingly the vast sympathy which is his peculiar dower."

<td>Fair Star of evening, Splendour of the west,<br>
Star of my Country!&mdash;on the horizon's brink<br>
Thou hangest, stooping, as might seem, to sink<br>
On England's bosom; yet well pleased to rest,<br>
Meanwhile, and be to her a glorious crest<br>
Conspicuous to the Nations. Thou, I think,<br>
Should'st be my Country's emblem; and should'st wink,<br>
Bright Star! with laughter on her banners, drest<br>
In thy fresh beauty. There! that dusky spot<br>
Beneath thee, that is England; there she lies.<br>
Blessings be on you both! one hope, one lot,<br>
One life, one glory!&mdash;I, with many a fear<br>
For my dear Country, many heartfelt sighs,<br>
Among men who do not love her, linger here.<br>

<a name="79n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">This sonnet, and the seven that follow it, were written during
Wordsworth's residence at Calais, in the month of August, 1802. The
following extract from his sister's Journal illustrates it:</span>

  <blockquote>"We arrived at <i>Calais</i> at four o'clock on Sunday morning the 31st of
  July. We had delightful walks after the heat of the day was
  passed&mdash;seeing far off in the west the coast of England, like a cloud,
  crested with Dover Castle, the evening Star, and the glory of the sky;
  the reflections in the water were more beautiful than the sky itself;
  purple waves brighter than precious stones, for ever melting away upon
  the sands."</blockquote>

<a name="81n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">This sonnet, originally entitled <i>To a Friend, composed near Calais, on
the Road leading to Ardres, August 7th, 1802</i>, was addressed to Robert
Jones, of Plas-yn-llan, near Ruthin, Denbighshire, a brother collegian
at Cambridge, and afterwards a fellow of St. John's College, and
incumbent of Soulderne, near Deddington, in Oxfordshire. It was to him
that Wordsworth dedicated his <i>Descriptive Sketches</i>, which record their
wanderings together in Switzerland; and it is to the pedestrian tour,
undertaken by the two friends in the long vacation of 1790, that he
refers in the above sonnet. The character of Jones is sketched in the
poem written in 1800, beginning:</span>

   <blockquote><a name="fr81C"></a> 'I marvel how Nature could ever find space,'<a href="#81C"><sup>C</sup></a></blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">and his parsonage in Oxfordshire is described in the sonnet:</span>

    <blockquote>'Where holy ground begins, unhallowed ends,<br>
    Is marked by no distinguishable line.'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The following note on Jones was appended to the edition of
1837:</span>

 <blockquote> "This excellent Person, one of my earliest and dearest friends, died
  in the year 1835. We were under-graduates together of the same year,
  at the same college; and companions in many a delightful ramble
  through his own romantic Country of North Wales. Much of the latter
  part of his life he passed in comparative solitude; which I know was
  often cheered by remembrance of our youthful adventures, and of the
  beautiful regions which, at home and abroad, we had visited together.
  Our long friendship was never subject to a moment's
  interruption,&mdash;and, while revising these volumes for the last time, I
  have been so often reminded of my loss, with a not unpleasing sadness,
  that I trust the Reader will excuse this passing mention of a Man who
  well deserves from me something more than so brief a notice. Let me
  only add, that during the middle part of his life he resided many
  years (as Incumbent of the Living) at a Parsonage in Oxfordshire,
  which is the subject of one of the <i>Miscellaneous Sonnets.</i>"</blockquote>

<a name="83A"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote A:</span></a> &nbsp;<span style="color: #555555;"> I thought, for some time, that the "girl" referred to was
Dorothy Wordsworth. Her brother used to speak, and to write, of her
under many names, "Emily," "Louisa," etc.; and to call her a "child" in
1802&mdash;a "child of Nature" she was to the end of her days&mdash;or a "girl,"
seemed quite natural. However, a more probable suggestion was made by
Mr. T. Hutchinson to Professor Dowden, that it refers to the girl
Caroline mentioned in Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Journal.</i> </span>

  <blockquote>"We arrived at Calais at four o'clock on Sunday morning, the 3rd of
  July.... We found out Annette and C., chez Madame Avril dans la rue de
  la T&ecirc;te d'or. The weather was very hot. We walked by the shore almost
  every evening with Annette and Caroline, or William and I alone.... It
  was beautiful on the calm hot night to see the little boats row out of
  harbour with wings of fire, and the sail-boats with the fiery track
  which they cut as they went along, and which closed up after them with
  a hundred thousand sparkles and streams of glowworm light. Caroline
  was delighted."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">I have been unable to discover who Annette and Caroline were. Dorothy
Wordsworth frequently records in her Grasmere Journal that either
William, or she, "wrote to Annette," but who she was is unknown to
either the Wordsworth or the Hutchinson family. &mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<blockquote>"Once did She hold the gorgeous east in fee."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The special glory of Venice dates from the conquest of Constantinople by
the Latins in 1202. The fourth Crusade&mdash;in which the French and
Venetians alone took part&mdash;started from Venice, in October 1202, under
the command of the Doge, Henry Dandolo. Its aim, however, was not the
recovery of Palestine, but the conquest of Constantinople. At the close
of the crusade, Venice received the Morea, part of Thessaly, the
Cyclades, many of the Byzantine cities, and the coasts of the
Hellespont, with three-eighths of the city of Constantinople itself, the
Doge taking the curious title of Duke of three-eighths of the Roman
Empire.</span>

 <blockquote> "And was the safeguard of the west."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">This may refer to the prominent part which Venice took in the Crusades,
or to the development of her naval power, which made her mistress of the
Mediterranean for many years, and an effective bulwark against invasions
from the East.</span>

  <blockquote>"The eldest Child of Liberty."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The origin of the Venetian State was the flight of many of
the inhabitants of the mainland&mdash;on the invasion of Italy by
Attila&mdash;to the chain of islands that lie at the head of the
Adriatic. </span>

 <blockquote> "In the midst of the waters, free, indigent, laborious, and
  inaccessible, they gradually coalesced into a republic: the first
  foundations of Venice were laid in the island of Rialto.... On the
  verge of the two empires the Venetians exult in the belief of
  primitive and perpetual independence."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Gibbon's <i>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>, chap. lx.</span>

 <blockquote> "And, when she took unto herself a Mate,<br>
  She must espouse the everlasting Sea."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">In 1177, Pope Alexander III. appealed to the Venetian Republic for
protection against the German Emperor. The Venetians were successful in
a naval battle at Saboro, against Otho, the son of Frederick Barbarossa.
In return, the Pope presented the Doge Liani with a ring, with which he
told him to wed the Adriatic, that posterity might know that the sea was
subject to Venice, "as a bride is to her husband."<br>
<br>
In September 1796, nearly six years before this sonnet was written, the
fate of the old Venetian Republic was sealed by the treaty of Campo
Formio. The French army under Napoleon had subdued Italy, and, having
crossed the Alps, threatened Vienna. To avert impending disaster, the
Emperor Francis arranged a treaty which extinguished the Venetian
Republic. He divided its territory between himself and Napoleon, Austria
retaining Istria, Dalmatia, and the left bank of the Adige in the
Venetian State, with the "maiden city" itself; France receiving the rest
of the territory and the Ionian Islands. Since the date of that treaty
the city has twice been annexed to Italy.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<a name="85n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">The following is Wordsworth's note to this sonnet, added in 1837:</span>

 <blockquote> "In this and a succeeding Sonnet on the same subject, let me be
  understood as a Poet availing himself of the situation which the King
  of Sweden occupied, and of the principles <b>Avowed in His Manifestos</b>; as
  laying hold of these advantages for the purpose of embodying moral
  truths. This <a name="fr85A">remark</a> might, perhaps, as well have been suppressed; for
  to those who may be in sympathy with the course of these Poems, it
  will be superfluous; and will, I fear, be thrown away upon that other
  class, whose besotted admiration of the intoxicated despot hereafter
  placed<a href="#85A"><sup>A</sup></a> in contrast with him, is the most melancholy evidence of
  degradation in British feeling and intellect which the times have
  furnished."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The king referred to is Gustavus IV., who was born in 1778, proclaimed
king in 1792, and died in 1837. His first public act after his accession
was to join in the coalition against Napoleon, and dislike of Napoleon
was the main-spring of his policy. It is to this that Wordsworth refers
in the sonnet:</span>

  <blockquote>'... the illustrious Swede hath done<br>
  The thing which ought to be ...'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">It made him unpopular, however, and gave rise to a conspiracy against
him, and to his consequent abdication in 1809. He "died forgotten and in
poverty."&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<a name="86n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp;<span style="color: #555555;"> Fran&ccedil;ois Dominique Toussaint (who was surnamed L'Ouverture), the child
of African slaves, was born at St. Domingo in 1743. He was a Royalist in
political sympathy till 1794, when the decree of the French convention,
giving liberty to the slaves, brought him over to the side of the
Republic. He was made a general of division by Laveux, and succeeded in
taking the whole of the north of the island from the English. In 1796 he
was made chief of the French army of St. Domingo, and first the British
commander, and next the Spanish, surrendered everything to him. He
became governor of the island, which prospered under his rule. Napoleon,
however, in 1801, issued an edict re-establishing slavery in St.
Domingo. Toussaint professed obedience, but showed that he meant to
resist the edict. A fleet of fifty-four vessels was sent from France to
enforce it. Toussaint was proclaimed an outlaw. He surrendered, and was
received with military honours, but was treacherously arrested and sent
to Paris in June 1802, where he died, in April 1803, after ten months'
hardship in prison. He had been two months in prison when Wordsworth
addressed this sonnet to him.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

  very pleasant to me, when we were in the harbour at Dover, to breathe
  the fresh air, and to look up and see the stars among the ropes of the
  vessel. The next day was very hot, we bathed, and sat upon the Dover
  Cliffs, and looked upon France with many a melancholy and tender
  thought. We could see the shores almost as plain as if it were but an
  English lake. We mounted the coach, and arrived in London at six, the
  30th August."</blockquote>

<br>
The <a href="#87n1">note</a> appended to the sonnet, <i>Composed in the Valley near Dover,
on the day of Landing</i> (p. 341), shows that this one refers to the
same occasion; and that while "Inland, within a hollow vale," Wordsworth
was, at the same time, on the Dover Cliffs; the "vale" being one of the
hollow clefts in the headland, which front the Dover coast-line. The
sonnet may, however, have been finished afterwards in London.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<h2><a name="section90"></a>Written in London, September, 1802</h2>

<h4>Composed September, 1802.&mdash;Published 1807</h4>

<a href="#section90a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[This was written immediately after my return from France to London,
when I could not but be struck, as here described, with the vanity and
parade of our own country, especially in great towns and cities, as
contrasted with the quiet, and I may say the desolation, that the
Revolution had produced in France. This must be borne in mind, or else
the reader may think that in this and the succeeding Sonnets I have
exaggerated the mischief engendered and fostered among us by undisturbed
wealth. It would not be easy to conceive with what a depth of feeling I
entered into the struggle carried on by the Spaniards for their
deliverance from the usurped power of the French. Many times have I gone
from Allan Bank in Grasmere Vale, where we were then residing, to the
top of Raise-gap, as it is called, so late as two o'clock in the
morning, to meet the carrier bringing the newspapers from Keswick.
Imperfect traces of the state of mind in which I then was may be found
in my tract on the Convention of Cintra, as well as in these
Sonnets.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>

<a href="#section95a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>

<span style="color: #663300;">[Composed October 4th, 1802, after a journey over the Hambleton Hills,
on a day memorable to me&mdash;the day of my marriage. The horizon commanded
by those hills is most magnificent. The next day, while we were
travelling in a post-chaise up Wensleydale, we were stopped by one of
the horses proving restive, and were obliged to wait two hours in a
severe storm before the post-boy could fetch from the inn another to
supply its place. The spot was in front of Bolton Hall, where Mary Queen
of Scots was kept prisoner, soon after her unfortunate landing at
Workington. The place then belonged to the Scroops, and memorials of her
are yet preserved there. To beguile the time I composed a Sonnet. The
subject was our own confinement contrasted with hers; but it was not
thought worthy of being preserved.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>

<a name="95n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp;<span style="color: #555555;"> The following extract from Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal indicates, as
fully as any other passage in it, the use which her brother occasionally
made of it. We have the "Grecian Temple," and the "Minster with its
Tower":</span>

 <blockquote> "Before we had crossed the Hambleton Hill and reached the point
  overlooking Yorkshire it was quite dark. We had not wanted, however,
  fair prospects before us, as we drove along the flat plain of the high
  hill; far, far off from us, in the western sky, we saw shapes of
  castles, ruins among groves&mdash;a great, spreading wood, rocks, and
  single trees&mdash;a Minster with its Tower unusually distinct, Minarets in
  another quarter, and a round Grecian Temple also; the colours of the
  sky of a bright grey, and the forms of a sober grey, with a dome. As
  we descended the hill there was no distinct view, but of a great
  space, only near us, we saw the wild (and as the people say)
  bottomless Tarn in the hollow at the side of the hill. It seemed to be
  made visible to us only by its own light, for all the hill about us
  was dark."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Wordsworth and his sister crossed over the Hambleton (or Hamilton)
Hills, on their way from Westmoreland to Gallow Hill, Yorkshire, to
visit the Hutchinsons, before they went south to London and Calais,
where they spent the month of August, 1802. But after his marriage to
Mary Hutchinson, on the 4th of October, Wordsworth, his wife, and
sister, recrossed these Hambleton Hills on their way to Grasmere, which
they reached on the evening of the 6th October. The above sonnet was
composed on the evening of the 4th October, as the Fenwick note
indicates.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

sad "presentiment" with which the <i>Lines composed above Tintern Abbey</i>
conclude. The following is the postscript to a letter by his father, S.
T. C., addressed to Sir Humphry Davy, Keswick, July 25, 1800:</span>

  <blockquote>"Hartley is a spirit that dances on an aspen leaf; the air that yonder
  sallow-faced and yawning tourist is breathing, is to my babe a
  perpetual nitrous oxide. Never was more joyous creature born. Pain
  with him is so wholly trans-substantiated by the joys that had rolled
  on before, and rushed on after, that oftentimes five minutes after his
  mother has whipt him he has gone up and asked her to whip him again."</blockquote>

Be violets in their secret mews <br>
The flowers the wanton Zephyrs choose;<br>
Proud be the rose, with rains and dews<br>
  Her head impearling,<br>
Thou liv'st with less ambitious aim,<br>
Yet hast not gone without thy fame;<br>
Thou art indeed by many a claim<br>
    The Poet's darling.<br><br>

If to a rock from rains he fly,<br>
Or, some bright day of April sky,<br>
Imprisoned by hot sunshine lie <br>
    Near the green holly,<br>
And wearily at length should fare;<br>
He needs but look about, and there<br>
Thou art!&mdash;a friend at hand, to scare<br>
    His melancholy.<br><br>

A hundred times, by rock or bower,<br>
Ere thus I have lain couched an hour,<br>
Have I derived from thy sweet power<br>
    Some apprehension;<br>
Some steady love; some brief delight;<br>
Some memory that had taken flight;<br>
Some chime of fancy wrong or right;<br>
    Or stray invention.<br><br>

If stately passions in me burn,<br>
And one chance look to Thee should turn,<br>
I drink out of an humbler urn<br>
    A lowlier pleasure;<br>
The homely sympathy that heeds<br>
The common life, our nature breeds;<br>
A wisdom fitted to the needs<br>
    Of hearts at leisure.<br><br>

Fresh-smitten by the morning ray,<br>
When thou art up, alert and gay,<br>
Then, cheerful Flower! my spirits play<br>
    With kindred gladness:<br>
And when, at dusk, by dews opprest<br>
Thou sink'st, the image of thy rest<br>
Hath often eased my pensive breast<br>
    Of careful sadness.<br><br>

And all day long I number yet,<br>
All seasons through, another debt,<br>
Which I, wherever thou art met,<br>
    To thee am owing;<br>
 An instinct call it, a blind sense;<br>
A happy, genial influence,<br>
Coming one knows not how, nor whence,<br>
    Nor whither going.<br><br>

Child of the Year! that round dost run<br>
Thy pleasant course,&mdash;when day's begun<br>
As ready to salute the sun<br>
    As lark or leveret,<br>
Thy long-lost praise thou shalt regain;<br>
Nor be less dear to future men<br>
Than in old time;&mdash;thou not in vain<br>
    Art Nature's favourite.<br>

 <span style="color: #555555;">The extract from Wither was first prefixed to this poem in
the edition of 1815. The late Mr. Dykes Campbell was of opinion that
Charles Lamb had suggested this motto to Wordsworth, as <i>The
Shepherd's Hunting</i> was Lamb's "prime favourite" amongst Wither's
poems. It may be as well to note that his quotation was erroneous in two
places. His "instruction" should be "invention" (l. 3), and his "the"
(in l. 4) should be "her."&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<a name="98C"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote C:</span></a> &nbsp; This Poem, and two others to the same Flower, which the
Reader will find in the second Volume, were written in the year 1802;
which is mentioned, because in some of the ideas, though not in the
manner in which those ideas are connected, and likewise even in some of
the expressions, they bear a striking resemblance to a Poem (lately
published) of Mr. Montgomery, entitled, <i>A Field Flower</i>. This
being said, Mr. Montgomery will not think any apology due to him; I
cannot however help addressing him in the words of the Father of English
Poets:

 <blockquote> 'Though it happe me to rehersin&mdash;<br>
  That ye han in your freshe songis saied,<br>
  Forberith me, and beth not ill apaied,<br>
  Sith that ye se I doe it in the honour<br>
  Of Love, and eke in service of the Flour.'</blockquote>

W. W. 1807.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">In the edition of 1836, the following variation of the text of this note
occurs: "There is a resemblance to passages in a Poem."&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<br>
<a name="98n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">For illustration of the last stanza, see Chaucer's Prologue to <i>The
Legend of Good Women</i>.</span>

 <blockquote> 'As I seyde erst, whanne comen is the May,<br>
  That in my bed ther daweth me no day,<br>
  That I nam uppe and walkyng in the mede,<br>
  To seen this floure agein the sonne sprede,<br>
  Whan it up rysith erly by the morwe;<br>
  That blisful sight softneth al my sorwe,<br>
  So glad am I, whan that I have presence<br>
  Of it, to doon it alle reverence,<br>
  As she that is of alle floures flour.'<br>
  ...<br>
  To seen this flour so yong, so fresshe of hewe,<br>
  Constreynde me with so gredy desire,<br>
  That in myn herte I feele yet the fire,<br>
  That made me to ryse er yt wer day,<br>
  And this was now the firste morwe of May,<br>
  With dredful hert, and glad devocioun<br>
  For to ben at the resurreccion<br>
  Of this flour, whan that yt shulde unclose<br>
  Agayne the sonne, that roos as rede as rose<br>
  ...<br>
  And doune on knes anoon ryght I me sette,<br>
  And as I koude, this fresshe flour I grette,<br>
  Knelying alwey, til it unclosed was,<br>
  Upon the smale, softe, swote gras.</blockquote>

Again, in The <i>Cuckoo and the Nightingale</i>, after a wakeful night,
the Poet rises at dawn, and wandering forth, reaches a "laund of white
and green."

<blockquote>  'So feire oon had I nevere in bene,<br>
  The grounde was grene, y poudred with days&eacute;,<br>
  The floures and the gras ilike al hie,<br>
  Al grene and white, was nothing elles sene.'</blockquote>

<td>With little here to do or see<br>
Of things that in the great world be,<br>
Daisy! again I talk to thee,<br>
    For thou art worthy,<br>
Thou unassuming Common-place <br>
Of Nature, with that homely face,<br>
And yet with something of a grace,<br>
  Which Love makes for thee!<br><br>

Oft on the dappled turf at ease<br>
I sit, and play with similes,<br>
Loose types of things through all degrees,<br>
  Thoughts of thy raising:<br>
And many a fond and idle name<br>
I give to thee, for praise or blame,<br>
As is the humour of the game,<br>
  While I am gazing.<br><br>

A nun demure of lowly port;<br>
Or sprightly maiden, of Love's court,<br>
In thy simplicity the sport<br>
  Of all temptations;<br>
A queen in crown of rubies drest;<br>
A starveling in a scanty vest;<br>
Are all, as seems to suit thee best,<br>
  Thy appellations.<br><br>

A little cyclops, with one eye <br>
Staring to threaten and defy,<br>
That thought comes next&mdash;and instantly<br>
  The freak is over,<br>
The shape will vanish&mdash;and behold<br>
A silver shield with boss of gold,<br>
That spreads itself, some faery bold<br>
  In fight to cover!<br><br>

I see thee glittering from afar&mdash;<br>
And then thou art a pretty star;<br>
Not quite so fair as many are <br>
  In heaven above thee!<br>
Yet like a star, with glittering crest,<br>
Self-poised in air thou seem'st to rest;&mdash;<br>
May peace come never to his nest,<br>
Who shall reprove thee!<br><br>

Bright <i>Flower!</i> for by that name at last,<br>
When all my reveries are past,<br>
I call thee, and to that cleave fast,<br>
Sweet silent creature!<br>
That breath'st with me in sun and air,<br>
Do thou, as thou art wont, repair<br>
My heart with gladness, and a share<br>
Of thy meek nature!<br>

<a name="99n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">The three preceding poems 'To the Daisy' evidently belong to the same
time, and are, as Wordsworth expressly says, "overflowings of the mind
in composing the one which stands first." Nevertheless, in the revised
edition of 1836-7, he gave the date 1802 to the first, 1803 to the
third, and 1805 to the second of them. In the earlier editions 1815 to
1832, they are all classed among the "Poems of the Fancy," but in the
edition of 1837, and afterwards, the last, "Bright Flower! whose home is
everywhere," is ranked among the "Poems of Sentiment and Reflection."
They should manifestly be placed together. Wordsworth's fourth poem <i>To
the Daisy</i>, which is an elegy on his brother John, and belongs to a
subsequent year&mdash; having no connection with the three preceding poems,
will be found in its chronological place.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<a name="100n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">Wordsworth gave as the date of the composition of this poem the year
1805; but he said of the following one, <i>To a Young Lady, who had been
Reproached for taking Long Walks in the Country</i>&mdash; "composed at the same
time" and "designed to make one piece"&mdash;that it was written in 1803.<br>
<br>
But it is certain that these following lines appeared in <i>The Morning
Post</i>, on Feb. 12, 1802, where they are headed <i>To a beautiful Young
Lady, who had been harshly spoken of on account of her fondness for
taking long walks in the Country</i>. There is difficulty, both in
ascertaining the exact date of composition, and in knowing who "Louisa"
or the "Young Lady" was. Mrs. Millicent G. Fawcett wrote to me several
years ago, suggesting, with some plausibility, a much earlier date, if
Dorothy Wordsworth was the lady referred to. She referred me to
Dorothy's letter to her aunt, Mrs. Crackenthorpe, written from
Windybrow, Keswick, in 1794, when staying there with her brother; and
says</span>

 <blockquote> "What inclined me to think that the poem was written earlier than 1805
  was that it anticipates Dorothy's marriage, and this would more
  naturally be present as a probable event in W. W.'s mind in 1794 or
  thereabouts than in 1805, after Dorothy had dedicated her life to her
  brother, to the exclusion of all wish to make a home of her own by
  marriage. The expression 'Healthy as a shepherd boy' is also more
  applicable to a girl of twenty-two than to a woman of thirty-three. Do
  you think it possible that the poem may have been written in 1794, and
  not published till later, when its application would be less evident
  to the family circle?"</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Dorothy Wordsworth's letter will be quoted in full in a later volume,
but the following extract from it may be given now:</span>

 <blockquote> "I cannot pass unnoticed that part of your letter in which you speak
  of my 'rambling about the country on foot.' So far from considering
  this as a matter for condemnation I rather thought it would have given
  my friends pleasure that I had courage to make use of the strength
  with which Nature has endowed me, when it not only procured me
  infinitely more pleasure than I should have received from sitting in a
  post-chaise, but was also the means of saving me at least thirty
  shillings."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">I do not think the date of composition can be so early as 1794. What may
be called internal, or structural, evidence is against it. Wordsworth
never could have written these two poems till after his settlement at
Dove Cottage. Besides, in 1794, he could have no knowledge of a possible
"nest in a green dale, a harbour and a hold"; while at that time his
sister had certainly no "cottage home." I believe they were written
after he took up his residence at Town-end (the date being uncertain);
and that they refer to his sister, and not to his wife. It has been
suggested by Mr. Ernest Coleridge (see <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i>, Oct. 21, 1893)
that they refer to Mary Hutchinson: but there is no evidence of
Wordsworth taking long country walks with her before their marriage, or
that she was "nymph-like," "fleet and strong," that she loved to "roam
the moorland," "in weather rough and bleak," or that she "hunted
waterfalls." The reference to his sister is confirmed by the omission of
the delightful second stanza of the poem in the last edition revised by
the poet, that of 1849, when she was a confirmed invalid at Rydal Mount.
Those "smiles to earth unknown," had then ceased for ever. The reason
why Wordsworth erased so delightful and wonderful a stanza, is to me
only explicable on the supposition, that it was his sister he referred
to, she who had accompanied him in former days, in so many of his "long
walks in the country." His wife never did this; she had not the physical
strength to do it; and, if she had been the person referred to,
Wordsworth would hardly, in 1845, have erased such a description of her,
as occurs in the stanza written in 1802, when she was still so vigorous.
Besides, Mary Wordsworth was in no sense "a Child of Nature," as Dorothy
was: while the testimony of the Wordsworth household is explicit, that
it was to his sister, and not to his wife, that the poet referred. I
find no difficulty in the allusion made in the second poem to Dorothy
being yet possibly a "Wife and Friend"; nor to the fact that it was
originally addressed "To a beautiful Young Lady." Neither Dorothy nor
Mary Wordsworth were physically "beautiful," according to our highest
standards; although the poet addressed the latter as "a Phantom of
delight," and as "a lovely apparition." It is quite true that it was
Mary Wordsworth's old age that was "serene and bright," while Dorothy's
was the very reverse; but the poet's anticipation of the future was
written when his sister was young, and was by far the stronger of the
two.&mdash;Ed.</span>

<h2><a name="section102"></a>1803</h2>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">The poems associated with the year 1803 consist mainly of the "Memorials
of a Tour in Scotland," which Wordsworth and his sister took&mdash;along with
Coleridge&mdash;in the autumn of that year, although many of these were not
written till some time after the Tour was finished. <i>The Green Linnet</i>
and <i>Yew-trees</i> were written in 1803, and some sonnets were composed in
the month of October; but, on the whole, 1803 was not a fruitful year in
Wordsworth's life, as regards his lyrics and smaller poems. Doubtless
both <i>The Prelude</i> and <i>The Excursion</i> were revised in 1803.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>
