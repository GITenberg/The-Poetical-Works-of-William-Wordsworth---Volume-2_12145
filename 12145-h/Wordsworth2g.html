<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">The poems associated with the year 1803 consist mainly of the "Memorials
of a Tour in Scotland," which Wordsworth and his sister took&mdash;along with
Coleridge&mdash;in the autumn of that year, although many of these were not
written till some time after the Tour was finished. <i>The Green Linnet</i>
and <i>Yew-trees</i> were written in 1803, and some sonnets were composed in
the month of October; but, on the whole, 1803 was not a fruitful year in
Wordsworth's life, as regards his lyrics and smaller poems. Doubtless
both <i>The Prelude</i> and <i>The Excursion</i> were revised in 1803.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<td>Beneath these fruit-tree boughs that shed<br>
Their snow white blossoms on my head,<br>
With brightest sunshine round me spread<br>
  Of spring's unclouded weather,<br>
In this sequestered nook how sweet<br>
To sit upon my orchard-seat!<br>
And birds and flowers once more to greet,<br>
  My last year's friends together.<br><br>

One have I marked, the happiest guest<br>
In all this covert of the blest:<br>
Hail to Thee, far above the rest<br>
  In joy of voice and pinion!<br>
Thou, Linnet! in thy green array,<br>
Presiding Spirit here to-day,<br>
Dost lead the revels of the May;<br>
  And this is thy dominion.<br><br>

While birds, and butterflies, and flowers,<br>
Make all one band of paramours,<br>
Thou, ranging up and down the bowers,<br>
  Art sole in thy employment:<br>
A Life, a Presence like the Air,<br>
Scattering thy gladness without care,<br>
Too blest with any one to pair;<br>
  Thyself thy own enjoyment.<br><br>

Amid yon tuft of hazel trees,<br>
That twinkle to the gusty breeze,<br>
Behold him perched in ecstacies,<br>
  Yet seeming still to hover;<br>
There! where the flutter of his wings<br>
Upon his back and body flings<br>
Shadows and sunny glimmerings,<br>
  That cover him all over.<br><br>

My dazzled sight he oft deceives,<br>
A Brother of the dancing leaves;<br>
Then flits, and from the cottage-eaves<br>
  Pours forth his song in gushes;<br>
As if by that exulting strain<br>
He mocked and treated with disdain<br>
The voiceless Form he chose to feign,<br>
  While fluttering in the bushes.<br>

<h2><a name="section104"></a>Yew-Trees</h2>

<h4>Composed 1803.&mdash;Published 1815</h4>

<a href="#section104a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[Written at Grasmere. These Yew-trees are still standing, but the spread
of that at Lorton is much diminished by mutilation. I will here mention
that a little way up the hill, on the road leading from Rosthwaite to
Stonethwaite (in Borrowdale) lay the trunk of a Yew-tree, which appeared
as you approached, so vast was its diameter, like the entrance of a
cave, and not a small one. Calculating upon what I have observed of the
slow growth of this tree in rocky situations, and of its durability, I
have often thought that the one I am describing must have been as old as
the Christian era. The Tree lay in the line of a fence. Great masses of
its ruins were strewn about, and some had been rolled down the hillside
and lay near the road at the bottom. As you approached the tree, you
were struck with the number of shrubs and young plants, ashes, etc.,
which had found a bed upon the decayed trunk and grew to no
inconsiderable height, forming, as it were, a part of the hedgerow. In
no part of England, or of Europe, have I ever seen a yew-tree at all
approaching this in magnitude, as it must have stood. By the bye,
Hutton, the old guide, of Keswick, had been so impressed with the
remains of this tree, that he used gravely to tell strangers that there
could be no doubt of its having been in existence before the
flood.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>

<td>There is a Yew-tree, pride of Lorton Vale,<br>
Which to this day stands single, in the midst<br>
Of its own darkness, as it stood of yore:<br>
Not loth to furnish weapons for the bands<br>
Of Umfraville or Percy ere they marched <br>
To Scotland's heaths; or those that crossed the sea<br>
And drew their sounding bows at Azincour,<br>

<br>
<a name="104n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">The text of this poem was never altered. The Lorton Yew-tree&mdash;which, in
1803, was "of vast circumference," the "pride of Lorton Vale," and
described as:
</span>
  <blockquote>  'a living thing<br>
  Produced too slowly ever to decay;<br>
  Of form and aspect too magnificent<br>
  To be destroyed&mdash;'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">does not now verify its poet's prediction of the future. Mr. Wilson
Robinson of Whinfell Hall, Cockermouth, wrote to me of it in May 1880:</span>

 <blockquote> "The tree in outline expanded towards the root considerably: then, at
  about two feet from the ground, the trunk began to separate into huge
  limbs, spreading in all directions. I once measured this trunk at its
  least circumference, and found it 23 feet 10 inches. For the last 50
  or 60 years the branches have been gradually dying on the S. E. side,
  and about 25 years ago a strong S. E. gale, coming with accumulated
  force down Hope Gill, and&mdash;owing to the tree being so open on that
  side&mdash;taking it laterally at a disadvantage, wrenched off one of the
  great side branches down to the ground, carrying away nearly a third
  of the tree. This event led to farther peril; for, the second portion
  having been sold to a cabinetmaker at Whitehaven for #15, this gave
  the impression that the wood was very valuable (owing to the celebrity
  of the tree); and a local woodmonger bought the remainder. Two men
  worked half a day to grub it up; but a Cockermouth medical gentleman,
  hearing what was going on, made representations to the owner, and it
  ended in the woodmen sparing the remainder of the tree, which was not
  much the worse for what had been done. Many large dead branches have
  also been cut off, and now we have to regret that the 'pride of Lorton
  Vale,' shorn of its ancient dignity, is but a ruin, much more
  venerable than picturesque."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The "fraternal Four of Borrowdale" are certainly "worthier still of
note." The "trunk" described in the Fenwick note, as on the road between
Rosthwaite and Stonethwaite, has disappeared long ago; but the "solemn
and capacious grove" existed till 1883 in its integrity. The description
in the poem is realistic throughout, while the visible scene suggests</span>

  <blockquote>"an ideal grove, in which the ghostly masters of mankind meet, and
  sleep, and offer worship to the Destiny that abides above them, while
  the mountain flood, as if from another world, makes music to which
  they dimly listen."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">(Stopford A. Brooke, in <i>Theology in the English Poets</i>, p. 259.) With
the first part of the poem Wordsworth's <i>Sonnet composed at &mdash;&mdash; Castle</i>
during the Scotch Tour of 1803 may be compared (p. 410). For a critical
estimate of the poem see <i>Modern Painters</i>, part III. sec. II, chap. iv.
Ruskin alludes to "the real and high action of the imagination in
Wordsworth's <i>Yew-trees</i> (perhaps the most vigorous and solemn bit of
forest landscape ever painted). It is too long to quote, but the reader
should refer to it: let him note especially, if painter, that pure touch
of colour, 'by sheddings from the pining umbrage tinged.'" See also
Coleridge's criticism in <i>Biographia Literaria</i>, vol. ii. p. I77,
edition 1847, and his daughter Sara's comment on her father's note.
There can be little doubt that, as Professor Dowden has suggested, the
lines 23 to 28 were suggested to Wordsworth by Virgil's lines in the
Sixth Book of the <i>&AElig;neid</i>, 273-284:</span>

 <blockquote> 'Vestibulum ante ipsum primisque in faucibus Orci<br>
  Luctus et ultrices posuere cubilia Cur&aelig;;<br>
  Pallentesque habitant Morbi, tristisque Senectus,<br>
  Et Metus, et malesuada Fames, ac turpis Egestas,<br>
  Terribiles visu form&aelig;, Letumque, Labosque;<br>
  Tum consanguineus Leti Sopor, et mala mentis<br>
  Gaudia, mortiferumque adverso in limine Bellum,<br>
  Ferreique Eumenidum thalami, et Discordia demens,<br>
  Vipereum crinem vittis innexa cruentis.<br>
    In medio ramos annosaque bracchia pandit<br>
  Ulmus opaca, ingens, quam sedem Somnia volgo<br>
  Vana tenere ferunt, foliisque sub omnibus h&aelig;rent.'<br>
<br>
<br>
  "The 'Four Yew Trees,' and the mysterious company which you have
  assembled there, 'Death the Skeleton and Time the Shadow.' It is a
  sight not for every youthful poet to dream of; it is one of the last
  results he must have gone thinking for years for."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">(Charles Lamb to Wordsworth, 1815.)<br>
<br>
In Crabb Robinson's <i>Diary</i>, a reference to the Yew-trees of Lorton and
Borrowdale will be found under date Sept. 16 and 20, 1816.</span>

 <blockquote> "The pride of Lorton Vale" is now a ruin, and has lost all its ancient
  majesty: but, until the close of 1883, the "fraternal four" of
  Borrowdale were still to be seen "in grand assemblage." Every one who
  has felt the power of Wordsworth's poetry,&mdash;and especially those who
  had visited the Seathwaite valley, and read the <i>Yew-Trees</i> under the
  shade of that once "solemn and capacious grove" before 1884,&mdash;must
  have felt as if they had lost a personal friend, when they heard that
  the "grove" was gone. The great gale of December 11, 1883, smote it
  fiercely, uprooting one of the trees, and blowing the others to
  ribbands. The following is Mr. Rawnsley's account of the disaster:

<blockquote>'Last week the gale that ravaged England did the Lake country much
    harm. We could spare many of the larch plantations, and could hear
    (with a sigh) of the fall of the giant Scotch firs opposite the
    little Scafell Inn at Rosthwaite, and that Watendlath had lost its
    pines; but who could spare those ancient Yews, the great

     <blockquote> "... fraternal Four of Borrowdale,<br>
      Joined in one solemn and capacious grove;<br>
      Huge trunks! and each particular trunk a growth<br>
      Of intertwisted fibres serpentine<br>
      Up-coiling, and inveterately convolved."</blockquote>

    'For beneath their pillared shade since Wordsworth wrote his poem,
    that Yew-tree grove has suggested to many a wanderer up Borrowdale,
    and visitant to the Natural Temple,

      <blockquote>"an ideal grove in which the ghostly masters of mankind meet, and
      sleep, and offer worship to the Destiny that abides above them,
      while the mountain flood, as if from another world, makes music to
      which they dimly listen."</blockquote>

    'These Yew-trees, seemingly

     <blockquote> "Produced too slowly ever to decay;<br>
      Of form and aspect too magnificent<br>
      To be destroyed,"</blockquote>

    'have been ruthlessly overthrown. One has been uprooted bodily; all
    the leaders and branches of the others have been wrenched from the
    main trunk; and the three still standing are bare poles and broken
    wreckage. Until one visits the spot one can have no conception of
    the wholesale destruction that the hurricane has wrought; until he
    looks on the huge rosy-hearted branches he cannot guess the
    tremendous force with which the tornado had fallen upon that "sable
    roof of boughs."<br>
<br>
    'For tornado or whirlwind it must needs have been. The Yews grew
    under the eastern flank of the hill called Base Brown. The gale
    raged from the westward. One could hardly believe it possible that
    the trees could have been touched by it; for the barrier hill on
    which they grew,&mdash;and under whose shelter they have seen centuries
    of storm,&mdash;goes straight upwards, betwixt them and the west. It was
    only realizable when, standing amid the wreckage, and looking across
    the valley, it was seen that a larch plantation had been entirely
    levelled, and evidently by a wind that was coming from the east, and
    directly toward the Yew-trees. On enquiring at Seathwaite Farm, one
    found that all the slates blown from the roof of that building on
    the west side, had been whirled up clean over the roof: and we can
    only surmise that the winds rushing from the west and north-west,
    and meeting the bastions of Glaramara and the Sty-head slopes, were
    whirled round in the 'cul-de-sac' of the valley, and moved with
    churning motion back from east to west over the Seathwaite Farm, and
    so in straight line across the beck, and up the slope to the
    Yew-tree cluster. With what a wrenching, and with what violence,
    these trees were in a moment shattered, only those can guess who now
    witness the ruins of the pillared shade, upon the "grassless floor
    of red-brown hue."'"</blockquote></blockquote>

<h2><a name="section107"></a> Memorials of a Tour in Scotland</h2>

<h4>1803</h4>

<span style="color: #555555;">These poems were first collected, under the above title, in the edition
of 1827. In 1807, nine of them&mdash;viz. <i>Rob Roy's Grave, The Solitary
Reaper, Stepping Westward, Glen Almain, or, The Narrow Glen, The Matron
of Jedborough and her Husband, To a Highland Girl, Sonnet, To the Sons
of Burns after visiting the Grave of their Father, Yarrow
Unvisited</i>,&mdash;were printed under the title, "Poems written during a Tour
in Scotland." This group begins the second volume of the edition of that
year. But in 1815 and 1820&mdash;when Wordsworth began to arrange his poems
in groups&mdash;they were distributed with the rest of the series in the
several artificial sections. Although some were composed after the Tour
was finished&mdash;and the order in which Wordsworth placed them is not the
order of the Scotch Tour itself&mdash;it is advisable to keep to his own
method of arrangement in dealing with this particular group, for the
same reason that we retain it in such a series as the Duddon
Sonnets.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

make a tour in Scotland. Poor Coleridge was at that time in bad spirits,
and somewhat too much in love with his own dejection; and he departed
from us, as is recorded in my Sister's Journal, soon after we left Loch
Lomond. The verses that stand foremost among these Memorials were not
actually written for the occasion, but transplanted from my <i>Epistle to
Sir George Beaumont</i>.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>

<td>The gentlest Shade that walked Elysian plains<br>
Might sometimes covet dissoluble chains;<br>
Even for the tenants of the zone that lies<br>
Beyond the stars, celestial Paradise,<br>
Methinks 'twould heighten joy, to overleap <br>
At will the crystal battlements, and peep<br>
Into some other region, though less fair,<br>
To see how things are made and managed there.<br>
Change for the worse might please, incursion bold<br>
Into the tracts of darkness and of cold; <br>
O'er Limbo lake with a&euml;ry flight to steer,<br>
And on the verge of Chaos hang in fear.<br>
Such animation often do I find,<br>
Power in my breast, wings growing in my mind,<br>
Then, when some rock or hill is overpast, <br>
Perchance without one look behind me cast,<br>
Some barrier with which Nature, from the birth<br>
Of things, has fenced this fairest spot on earth.<br>
O pleasant transit, Grasmere! to resign<br>
Such happy fields, abodes so calm as thine; <br>
Not like an outcast with himself at strife;<br>
The slave of business, time, or care for life,<br>
But moved by choice; or, if constrained in part,<br>
Yet still with Nature's freedom at the heart;&mdash;<br>
To cull contentment upon wildest shores, <br>
And luxuries extract from bleakest moors;<br>
With prompt embrace all beauty to enfold,<br>
And having rights in all that we behold.<br>
&mdash;Then why these lingering steps?&mdash;A bright adieu,<br>
For a brief absence, proves that love is true; <br>
Ne'er can the way be irksome or forlorn<br>
That winds into itself for sweet return.<br>

not actually written till 1811. It originally formed the opening
paragraph of the 'Epistle to Sir George Beaumont'. Wordsworth himself
dated it 1804. It is every way desirable that it should introduce the

<td>I shiver, Spirit fierce and bold,<br>
At thought of what I now behold:<br>
As vapours breathed from dungeons cold<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Strike pleasure dead,<br>
So sadness comes from out the mould <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Burns is laid.<br><br>

And have I then thy bones so near,<br>
And thou forbidden to appear?<br>
As if it were thyself that's here<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shrink with pain; <br>
And both my wishes and my fear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alike are vain.<br>
<br>
Off weight&mdash;nor press on weight!&mdash;away<br>
Dark thoughts!&mdash;they came, but not to stay;<br>
With chastened feelings would I pay <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tribute due<br>
To him, and aught that hides his clay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From mortal view.<br><br>

Fresh as the flower, whose modest worth<br>
He sang, his genius "glinted" forth,<br>
Rose like a star that touching earth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For so it seems,<br>
Doth glorify its humble birth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With matchless beams.<br><br>

The piercing eye, the thoughtful brow,<br>
The struggling heart, where be they now?&mdash;<br>
Full soon the Aspirant of the plough,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prompt, the brave,<br>
Slept, with the obscurest, in the low<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And silent grave. <br><br>

I mourned with thousands, but as one<br>
More deeply grieved, for He was gone<br>
Whose light I hailed when first it shone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And showed my youth<br>
How Verse may build a princely throne<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On humble truth.<br><br>

Alas! where'er the current tends,<br>
Regret pursues and with it blends,&mdash;<br>
Huge Criffel's hoary top ascends<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By Skiddaw seen,&mdash;<br>
Neighbours we were, and loving friends<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We might have been;<br><br>

True friends though diversely inclined;<br>
But heart with heart and mind with mind,<br>
Where the main fibres are entwined,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through Nature's skill,<br>
May even by contraries be joined<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More closely still.<br><br>

The tear will start, and let it flow;<br>
Thou "poor Inhabitant below,"<br>
At this dread moment&mdash;even so&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Might we together<br>
Have sate and talked where gowans blow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or on wild heather.<br><br>

What treasures would have then been placed<br>
Within my reach; of knowledge graced<br>
By fancy what a rich repast!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But why go on?&mdash;<br>
Oh! spare to sweep, thou mournful blast,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His grave grass-grown. <br><br>

There, too, a Son, his joy and pride,<br>
(Not three weeks past the Stripling died,)<br>
Lies gathered to his Father's side,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soul-moving sight!<br>
Yet one to which is not denied<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some sad delight.<br><br>

For <i>he</i> is safe, a quiet bed<br>
Hath early found among the dead,<br>
Harboured where none can be misled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wronged, or distrest;<br>
And surely here it may be said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That such are blest.<br><br>

And oh for Thee, by pitying grace<br>
Checked oft-times in a devious race,<br>
May He who halloweth the place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Man is laid<br>
Receive thy Spirit in the embrace<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For which it prayed!<br><br>

Sighing I turned away; but ere<br>
Night fell I heard, or seemed to hear,<br>
Music that sorrow comes not near,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A ritual hymn,<br>
Chanted in love that casts out fear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By Seraphim.<br>

<a name="109n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">The following is an extract from Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Journal</i> of the
Tour in Scotland:</span>

  <blockquote>"Thursday, August 18th.&mdash; Went to the churchyard where Burns is
  buried. A bookseller accompanied us. He showed us the outside of
  Burns's house, where he had lived the last three years of his life,
  and where he died. It has a mean appearance, and is in a bye
  situation, whitewashed.... Went on to visit his grave. He lies at a
  corner of the churchyard, and his second son, Francis Wallace, beside
  him. There is no stone to mark the spot; but a hundred guineas have
  been collected, to be expended on some sort of monument.

    <blockquote>'There,' said the bookseller, pointing to a pompous monument, 'there
    lies Mr. Such-a-one. I have forgotten his name. A remarkably clever
    man; he was an attorney, and hardly ever lost a cause he undertook.
    Burns made many a lampoon upon him, and there they rest, as you
    see.'</blockquote>

  We looked at the grave with melancholy and painful reflections,
  repeating to each other his own verses.

   <blockquote> 'Is there a man whose judgment clear,<br>
    Can others teach the way to steer,<br>
    Yet runs himself life's mad career,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wild as the wave?<br>
    Here let him pause, and through a tear<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Survey this grave.<br>
    <br>
    The poor Inhabitant below<br>
    Was quick to learn, and wise to know,<br>
    And keenly felt the friendly glow,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And softer flame;<br>
    But thoughtless follies laid him low<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And stained his name.'</blockquote>

  "I cannot take leave of the country which we passed through to-day
  without mentioning that we saw the Cumberland Mountains, within
  half-a-mile of Ellisland, Burns's house, the last view we had of them.
  Drayton has prettily described the connection which this neighbourhood
  has with ours when he makes Skiddaw say:

   <blockquote>                 <a name="fr109E"></a> 'Seurfell<a href="#109E"><sup>E</sup></a> from the sky,<br>
    That Anadale<a href="#109F"><sup>F</sup></a> doth crown, with a most amorous eye,<br>
    Salutes me every day, or at my pride looks grim,<br>
    Oft threatening me with clouds, as I oft threatening him!'</blockquote>

  "These lines recurred to William's memory, and we talked of Burns, and
  of the prospect he must have had, perhaps from his own door, of
  Skiddaw and his companions, including ourselves in the fancy, that we
  <i>might</i> have been personally known to each other, and he have looked
  upon those objects with more pleasure for our sakes."</blockquote>

<td>Too frail to keep the lofty vow<br>
That must have followed when his brow<br>
Was wreathed&mdash;"The Vision" tells us how&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With holly spray,<br>
He faultered, drifted to and fro,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And passed away.<br><br>

Well might such thoughts, dear Sister, throng<br>
Our minds when, lingering all too long,<br>
Over the grave of Burns we hung<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In social grief&mdash;<br>
Indulged as if it were a wrong<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To seek relief.<br><br>

But, leaving each unquiet theme<br>
Where gentlest judgments may misdeem,<br>
And prompt to welcome every gleam<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of good and fair,<br>
Let us beside this limpid Stream<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breathe hopeful air.<br><br>

Enough of sorrow, wreck, and blight;<br>
Think rather of those moments bright<br>
When to the consciousness of right<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His course was true,<br>
When Wisdom prospered in his sight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And virtue grew.<br><br>

Yes, freely let our hearts expand,<br>
Freely as in youth's season bland,<br>
When side by side, his Book in hand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We wont to stray,<br>
Our pleasure varying at command<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of each sweet Lay.<br><br>

How oft inspired must he have trod<br>
These pathways, yon far-stretching road!<br>
There lurks his home; in that Abode,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With mirth elate,<br>
Or in his nobly-pensive mood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Rustic sate.<br><br>

Proud thoughts that Image overawes,<br>
Before it humbly let us pause,<br>
And ask of Nature, from what cause<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And by what rules<br>
She trained her Burns to win applause<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That shames the Schools.<br><br>

Through busiest street and loneliest glen<br>
Are felt the flashes of his pen;<br>
He rules mid winter snows, and when <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bees fill their hives;<br>
Deep in the general heart of men<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His power survives.<br><br>

What need of fields in some far clime<br>
Where Heroes, Sages, Bards sublime,<br>
And all that fetched the flowing rhyme<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  From genuine springs,<br>
Shall dwell together till old Time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Folds up his wings?<br><br>

Sweet Mercy! to the gates of Heaven<br>
This Minstrel lead, his sins forgiven;<br>
The rueful conflict, the heart riven<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With vain endeavour,<br>
And memory of Earth's bitter leaven,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Effaced for ever.<br><br>

But why to Him confine the prayer,<br>
When kindred thoughts and yearnings bear<br>
On the frail heart the purest share<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With all that live?&mdash;<br>
The best of what we do and are,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just God, forgive!<br>

  <blockquote>'These pathways, yon far-stretching road!'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">refers probably to the road to Brownhill, past Ellisland farmhouse
where Burns lived. "The day following" would be Aug. 19th,
1803. The extract which follows from the <i>Journal</i> is a further
illustration of the poem. August 8th.</span>

  <blockquote>"... Travelled through the vale of Nith, here little like a vale, it
  is so broad, with irregular hills rising up on each side, in outline
  resembling the old-fashioned valances of a bed. There is a great deal
  of arable land; the corn ripe; trees here and there&mdash;plantations,
  clumps, coppices, a newness in everything. So much of the gorse and
  broom rooted out that you wonder why it is not all gone, and yet there
  seems to be almost as much gorse and broom as corn; and they grow one
  among another you know not how. Crossed the Nith; the vale becomes
  narrow, and very pleasant; cornfields, green hills, clay cottages; the
  river's bed rocky, with woody banks. Left the Nith about a mile and a
  half, and reached Brownhill, a lonely inn, where we slept. The view
  from the windows was pleasing, though some travellers might have been
  disposed to quarrel with it for its general nakedness; yet there was
  abundance of corn. It is an open country&mdash;open, yet all over hills. At
  a little distance were many cottages among trees, that looked very
  pretty. Brownhill is about seven or eight miles from Ellisland. I
  fancied to myself, while I was sitting in the parlour, that Burns
  might have caroused there, for most likely his rounds extended so far,
  and this thought gave a melancholy interest to the smoky walls...."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">On Dec. 23, 1839, Wordsworth wrote to Professor Henry Reed,
Philadelphia:</span>

  <blockquote>"The other day I chanced to be looking over a MS. poem belonging to
  the year 1803, though not actually composed till many years
  afterwards. It was suggested by visiting the neighbourhood of
  Dumfries, in which Burns had resided, and where he died: it concluded
  thus:

   <blockquote> 'Sweet Mercy! to the gates of Heaven, etc.'</blockquote>

  I instantly added, the other day,

   <blockquote> 'But why to Him confine the prayer, etc.'</blockquote>

  The more I reflect upon this, the more I feel justified in attaching
  comparatively small importance to any literary monument that I may be
  enabled to leave behind. It is well however, I am convinced, that men
  think otherwise in the earlier part of their lives...."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">It may be mentioned that in his note to the "Poems, chiefly
of Early and Late Years," (1842), Wordsworth does not quote
from the text of his sister's <i>Journal</i>,&mdash;which was first published
in 1875,&mdash;but from some other copy of it.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<td>'Mid crowded obelisks and urns<br>
I sought the untimely grave of Burns;<br>
Sons of the Bard, my heart still mourns<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With sorrow true;<br>
And more would grieve, but that it turns <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trembling to you!<br><br>

Through twilight shades of good and ill<br>
Ye now are panting up life's hill,<br>
And more than common strength and skill<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must ye display;<br>
If ye would give the better will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its lawful sway.<br><br>

Hath Nature strung your nerves to bear<br>
Intemperance with less harm, beware!<br>
But if the Poet's wit ye share,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like him can speed<br>
The social hour&mdash;of tenfold care<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be need;<br><br>

For honest men delight will take<br>
To spare your failings for his sake,<br>
Will flatter you,&mdash;and fool and rake<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your steps pursue;<br>
And of your Father's name will make<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A snare for you.<br><br>

Far from their noisy haunts retire,<br>
And add your voices to the quire<br>
That sanctify the cottage fire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With service meet;<br>
There seek the genius of your Sire,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His spirit greet;<br><br>

Or where,'mid "lonely heights and hows,"<br>
He paid to Nature tuneful vows;<br>
Or wiped his honourable brows<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bedewed with toil,<br>
While reapers strove, or busy ploughs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upturned the soil;<br><br>

His judgment with benignant ray<br>
Shall guide, his fancy cheer, your way;<br>
But ne'er to a seductive lay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let faith be given;<br>
Nor deem that "light which leads astray,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is light from Heaven."<br><br>

Let no mean hope your souls enslave;<br>
Be independent, generous, brave;<br>
Your Father such example gave,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And such revere;<br>
But be admonished by his grave,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And think, and fear!<br>

<td>Sweet Highland Girl, a very shower<br>
Of beauty is thy earthly dower!<br>
Twice seven consenting years have shed<br>
Their utmost bounty on thy head:<br>
And these grey rocks; that household lawn;<br>
Those trees, a veil just half withdrawn;<br>
This fall of water that doth make<br>
A murmur near the silent lake;<br>
This little bay; a quiet road<br>
That holds in shelter thy Abode&mdash;<br>
In truth together do ye seem<br>
Like something fashioned in a dream;<br>
Such Forms as from their covert peep<br>
When earthly cares are laid asleep!<br>
But, O fair Creature! in the light<br>
Of common day, so heavenly bright,<br>
I bless Thee, Vision as thou art,<br>
I bless thee with a human heart;<br>
God shield thee to thy latest years!<br>
Thee, neither know I, nor thy peers;<br>
And yet my eyes are filled with tears.<br><br>

  With earnest feeling I shall pray<br>
For thee when I am far away:<br>
For never saw I mien, or face,<br>
In which more plainly I could trace<br>
Benignity and home-bred sense<br>
Ripening in perfect innocence.<br>
Here scattered, like a random seed,<br>
Remote from men, Thou dost not need<br>
The embarrassed look of shy distress,<br>
And maidenly shamefacedness:<br>
Thou wear'st upon thy forehead clear<br>
The freedom of a Mountaineer:<br>
A face with gladness overspread!<br>
Soft smiles, by human kindness bred!<br>
And seemliness complete, that sways<br>
Thy courtesies, about thee plays;<br>
With no restraint, but such as springs<br>
From quick and eager visitings<br>
Of thoughts that lie beyond the reach<br>
Of thy few words of English speech:<br>
A bondage sweetly brooked, a strife<br>
That gives thy gestures grace and life!<br>
So have I, not unmoved in mind,<br>
Seen birds of tempest-loving kind&mdash;<br>
Thus beating up against the wind.<br><br>

  What hand but would a garland cull<br>
For thee who art so beautiful?<br>
O happy pleasure! here to dwell<br>
Beside thee in some heathy dell;<br>
Adopt your homely ways and dress,<br>
A Shepherd, thou a Shepherdess!<br>
But I could frame a wish for thee<br>
More like a grave reality:<br>
Thou art to me but as a wave<br>
Of the wild sea; and I would have<br>
Some claim upon thee, if I could,<br>
Though but of common neighbourhood.<br>
What joy to hear thee, and to see!<br>
Thy elder Brother I would be,<br>
Thy Father&mdash;anything to thee!<br><br>

  Now thanks to Heaven! that of its grace<br>
Hath led me to this lonely place.<br>
Joy have I had; and going hence<br>
I bear away my recompence.<br>
In spots like these it is we prize<br>
Our Memory, feel that she hath eyes:<br>
Then, why should I be loth to stir?<br>
I feel this place was made for her;<br>
To give new pleasure like the past,<br>
Continued long as life shall last.<br>
Nor am I loth, though pleased at heart,<br>
Sweet Highland Girl! from thee to part;<br>
For I, methinks, till I grow old,<br>
As fair before me shall behold,<br>
As I do now, the cabin small,<br>
The lake, the bay, the waterfall;<br>
And Thee, the Spirit of them all!<br>

Wordsworth writes:</span>

  <blockquote>"Sunday, August 28th.&mdash;... After long waiting, the girls, who had been
  on the look-out, informed us that the boat was coming. I went to the
  waterside, and saw a cluster of people on the opposite shore; but,
  being yet at a distance, they looked more like soldiers surrounding a
  carriage than a group of men and women; red and green were the
  distinguishable colours. We hastened to get ourselves ready as soon as
  we saw the party approach, but had longer to wait than we expected,
  the lake being wider than it appears to be. As they drew near we could
  distinguish men in tartan plaids, women in scarlet cloaks, and green
  umbrellas by the half-dozen. The landing was as pretty a sight as ever
  I saw. The bay, which had been so quiet two days before, was all in
  motion with small waves, while the swollen waterfall roared in our
  ears. The boat came steadily up, being pressed almost to the water's
  edge by the weight of its cargo; perhaps twenty people landed, one
  after another. It did not rain much, but the women held up their
  umbrellas; they were dressed in all the colours of the rainbow, and
  with their scarlet cardinals, the tartan plaids of the men, and Scotch
  bonnets, made a gay appearance. There was a joyous bustle surrounding
  the boat, which even imparted something of the same character to the
  waterfall in its tumult, and the restless grey waves; the young men
  laughed and shouted, the lasses laughed, and the elder folks seemed to
  be in a bustle to be away. I remember well with what haste the
  mistress of the house where we were ran up to seek after her child,
  and seeing us, how anxiously and kindly she inquired how we had fared,
  if we had had a good fire, had been well waited upon, etc. All this in
  three minutes&mdash;for the boatman had another party to bring from the
  other side, and hurried us off.<br>
<br>
  "The hospitality we had met with at the two cottages and Mr.
  Macfarlane's gave us very favourable impressions on this our first
  entrance into the Highlands, and at this day the innocent merriment of
  the girls, with their kindness to us, and the beautiful face and
  figure of the elder, come to my mind whenever I think of the
  ferry-house and waterfall of Loch Lomond, and I never think of the two
  girls but the whole image of that romantic spot is before me, a living
  image as it will be to my dying day. The following poem was written by
  William not long after our return from Scotland."</blockquote>

<td>In this still place, remote from men,<br>
Sleeps Ossian, in the <b>Narrow Glen</b>;<br>
In this still place, where murmurs on<br>
But one meek streamlet, only one:<br>
He sang of battles, and the breath<br>
Of stormy war, and violent death;<br>
And should, methinks, when all was past,<br>
Have rightfully been laid at last<br>
Where rocks were rudely heaped, and rent<br>
As by a spirit turbulent;<br>
Where sights were rough, and sounds were wild,<br>
And everything unreconciled;<br>
In some complaining, dim retreat,<br>
For fear and melancholy meet;<br>
But this is calm; there cannot be<br>
A more entire tranquillity.<br><br>

  Does then the Bard sleep here indeed?<br>
Or is it but a groundless creed?<br>
What matters it?&mdash;I blame them not<br>
Whose Fancy in this lonely Spot<br>
Was moved; and in such way expressed<br>
Their notion of its perfect rest.<br>
A convent, even a hermit's cell,<br>
Would break the silence of this Dell:<br>
It is not quiet, is not ease;<br>
But something deeper far than these:<br>
The separation that is here<br>
Is of the grave; and of austere<br>
Yet happy feelings of the dead:<br>
And, therefore, was it rightly said<br>
That Ossian, last of all his race!<br>
Lies buried in this lonely place.<br>

It must have been a warm August day, after a tract of dry weather, when
he went through it, or the Almond would scarcely have been called a
"small streamlet." In many seasons of the year the distinctive features
of the Glen would be more appropriately indicated by the words, which
the poet uses by way of contrast with his own experience of it, viz. a
place</span>

  <blockquote>'Where sights are rough, and sounds are wild,<br>
  And everything unreconciled.'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">But his characterization of the place&mdash;a glen, the charm of which is
little known&mdash;in the stillness of an autumn afternoon, is as true to
nature as any of his interpretations of the spirit of the hills and
vales of Westmoreland. As yet there is no farm-house, scarcely even a
sheiling, to "break the silence of this Dell."<br>
<br>
The following is Dorothy Wordsworth's account of their walk through it
on Friday, September 9th, 1803:</span>

 <blockquote> "Entered the glen at a small hamlet at some distance from the head,
  and, turning aside a few steps, ascended a hillock which commanded a
  view to the top of it&mdash;a very sweet scene, a green valley, not very
  narrow, with a few scattered trees and huts, almost invisible in a
  misty green of afternoon light. At this hamlet we crossed a bridge,
  and the road led us down the glen, which had become exceedingly
  narrow, and so continued to the end: the hills on both sides heathy
  and rocky, very steep, but continuous; the rock not single or
  overhanging, not scooped into caverns, or sounding with torrents;
  there are no trees, no houses, no traces of cultivation, not one
  outstanding object. It is truly a solitude, the road even making it
  appear still more so; the bottom of the valley is mostly smooth and
  level, the brook not noisy: everything is simple and undisturbed, and
  while we passed through it the whole place was shady, cool, clear, and
  solemn. At the end of the long valley we ascended a hill to a great
  height, and reached the top, when the sun, on the point of setting,
  shed a soft yellow light upon every eminence. The prospect was very
  extensive; over hollows and plains, no towns, and few houses
  visible&mdash;a prospect, extensive as it was, in harmony with the secluded
  dell, and fixing its own peculiar character of removedness from the
  world, and the secure possession of the quiet of nature more deeply in
  our minds. The following poem was written by William on hearing of a
  tradition relating to it, which we did not know when we were there."</blockquote>

<h2><a name="section114"></a>Stepping Westward</h2>

<h4>Composed between 1803 and 1805.&mdash;Published 1807</h4>

<a href="#section114a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
While my Fellow-traveller and I were walking by the side of Loch
Ketterine, one fine evening after sun-set, in our road to a Hut where in
the course of our Tour we had been hospitably entertained some weeks
before, we met, in one of the loneliest parts of that solitary region,
two well dressed Women, one of whom said to us, by way of greeting,
"What, you are stepping westward?"&mdash;W. W. 1807.<br>

  'Twould be a <i>wildish</i> destiny, <br>
If we, who thus together roam <br>
In a strange Land, and far from home,<br>
Were in this place the guests of Chance:<br>
Yet who would stop, or fear to advance, <br>
Though home or shelter he had none, <br>
With such a sky to lead him on?<br><br>

The dewy ground was dark and cold;<br>
Behind, all gloomy to behold;<br>
And stepping westward seemed to be<br>
A kind of <i>heavenly</i> destiny:<br>
I liked the greeting; 'twas a sound<br>
Of something without place or bound;<br>
And seemed to give me spiritual right<br>
To travel through that region bright. <br><br>

The voice was soft, and she who spake<br>
Was walking by her native lake:<br>
The salutation had to me<br>
The very sound of courtesy: <br>
Its power was felt; and while my eye<br>
Was fixed upon the glowing Sky,<br>
The echo of the voice enwrought<br>
A human sweetness with the thought<br>
Of travelling through the world that lay <br>
Before me in my endless way.<br>

 <blockquote> "Sunday, Sept. 11th.&mdash;We have never had a more delightful walk than
  this evening. Ben Lomond and the three pointed-topped mountains of
  Loch Lomond, which we had seen from the garrison, were very majestic
  under the clear sky, the lake perfectly calm, the air sweet and mild.
  I felt that it was much more interesting to visit a place where we
  have been before than it can possibly be the first time, except under
  peculiar circumstances. The sun had been set for some time, when,
  being within a quarter of a mile of the ferry man's hut, our path
  having led us close to the shore of the calm lake, we met two
  neatly-dressed women, without hats, who had probably been taking their
  Sunday evening's walk. One of them said to us in a friendly, soft tone
  of voice, 'What, you are stepping westward?' I cannot describe how
  affecting this simple expression was in that remote place, with the
  western sky in front, yet glowing with the departed sun. William wrote
  the following poem long after, in remembrance of his feelings and
  mine."</blockquote>

<td>Behold her, single in the field,<br>
Yon solitary Highland Lass!<br>
Reaping and singing by herself;<br>
Stop here, or gently pass!<br>
Alone she cuts and binds the grain,<br>
And sings a melancholy strain;<br>
O listen! for the Vale profound<br>
Is overflowing with the sound.<br><br>

No Nightingale did ever chaunt<br>
More welcome notes to weary bands<br>
Of travellers in some shady haunt,<br>
Among Arabian sands:<br>
A voice so thrilling ne'er was heard<br>
In spring-time from the Cuckoo-bird,<br>
Breaking the silence of the seas<br>
Among the farthest Hebrides.<br><br>

Will no one tell me what she sings?&mdash;<br>
Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow<br>
For old, unhappy, far-off things,<br>
And battles long ago:<br>
Or is it some more humble lay,<br>
Familiar matter of to-day?<br>
Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,<br>
That has been, and may be again?<br><br>

Whate'er the theme, the Maiden sang<br>
As if her song could have no ending;<br>
I saw her singing at her work,<br>
And o'er the sickle bending;&mdash;<br>
I listened, motionless and still;<br>
And, as I mounted up the hill, <br>
The music in my heart I bore,<br>
Long after it was heard no more.<br>

<a name="115n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">The following is from Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Recollections</i> of the Tour:
13th Sept. 1803.</span>

 <blockquote> "As we descended, the scene became more fertile, our way being
  pleasantly varied&mdash;through coppices or open fields, and passing
  farm-houses, though always with an intermixture of cultivated ground.
  It was harvest-time, and the fields were quietly&mdash;might I be allowed
  to say pensively?&mdash;enlivened by small companies of reapers. It is not
  uncommon in the more lonely parts of the Highlands to see a single
  person so employed. The following poem was suggested to William by a
  beautiful sentence in Thomas Wilkinson's <i>Tour in Scotland.</i>"</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">In a note appended to the editions 1807 to 1820, Wordsworth wrote:</span>

 <blockquote> "This Poem was suggested by a beautiful sentence in a MS. 'Tour in
  Scotland,' written by a Friend, the last line being taken from it
  <i>verbatim.</i>"</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The first part of Wilkinson's <i>Tours to the British Mountains</i>, which
was published in 1824, narrates his journey in Scotland (it took place
in 1787); and the following sentence occurs in the record of his travels
near Loch Lomond (p. 12),</span>

  <blockquote>"Passed a female who was reaping alone: she sung in Erse, as she
  bended over her sickle; the sweetest human voice I ever heard: her
  strains were tenderly melancholy, and felt delicious, long after they
  were heard no more."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">There can be no doubt that this is the sentence referred to both by
Dorothy and William Wordsworth. Thomas Wilkinson was the friend, in
whose memory Wordsworth wrote the poem <i>To the Spade of a Friend,
composed while we were labouring together in his pleasure-ground</i>. They
were comparatively near neighbours, as Wilkinson lived near Yanwath on
the Emont; and he had given his MS. to the Wordsworth family to read. I
have received some additional information about this MS., and
Wordsworth's knowledge of it, from Mr. Wilson Robinson, who writes,</span>

 <blockquote> "From all the evidence, I conclude that Wilkinson's 'Tour to the
  Highlands' was shown in manuscript to his friends soon after his
  return;&mdash;that he was not only willing to show it, but even to allow it
  to be copied, though reluctant to publish it;&mdash;that there was
  sufficient intimacy between him and the Wordsworths to account for his
  showing or lending the manuscript to them, especially as they had
  travelled over much of the same ground, and would therefore be more
  interested in it; and that in fact it was never published till 1824."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">When Wordsworth was living at Coleorton during the late autumn of 1806
he wrote to Wilkinson:</span>

<blockquote>  "... What shall I say in apology for your Journal, which is now locked
  up with my manuscripts at Grasmere. As I could not go over to your
  part of the country myself, my intention was to have taken it with me
  to Kendal,... to be carefully transmitted to you; unluckily, most
  unluckily, in the hurry of departure, I forgot it, together with two
  of my own manuscripts which were along with it; and I am afraid you
  will be standing in great need of it.... If you do not want it, it is
  in a place where it can take no injury, and I may have the pleasure of
  delivering it to you myself in the spring...."</blockquote>

<td>Child of loud-throated War! the mountain Stream<br>
Roars in thy hearing; but thy hour of rest<br>
Is come, and thou art silent in thy age;<br>
Save when the wind sweeps by and sounds are caught<br>
Ambiguous, neither wholly thine nor theirs.<br>
Oh! there is life that breathes not; Powers there are<br>
That touch each other to the quick in modes<br>
Which the gross world no sense hath to perceive,<br>
No soul to dream of. What art Thou, from care<br>
Cast off&mdash;abandoned by thy rugged Sire,<br>
Nor by soft Peace adopted; though, in place<br>
And in dimension, such that thou might'st seem<br>
But a mere footstool to yon sovereign Lord,<br>
Huge Cruachan, (a thing that meaner hills<br>
Might crush, nor know that it had suffered harm;)<br>
Yet he, not loth, in favour of thy claims<br>
To reverence, suspends his own; submitting<br>
All that the God of Nature hath conferred,<br>
All that he holds in common with the stars,<br>
To the memorial majesty of Time<br>
Impersonated in thy calm decay!<br><br>

Take, then, thy seat, Vicegerent unreproved!<br>
Now, while a farewell gleam of evening light<br>
Is fondly lingering on thy shattered front,<br>
Do thou, in turn, be paramount; and rule<br>
Over the pomp and beauty of a scene<br>
Whose mountains, torrents, lake, and woods, unite<br>
To pay thee homage; and with these are joined,<br>
In willing admiration and respect,<br>
Two Hearts, which in thy presence might be called<br>
Youthful as Spring.&mdash;Shade of departed Power,<br>
Skeleton of unfleshed humanity,<br>
The chronicle were welcome that should call<br>
Into the compass of distinct regard<br>
The toils and struggles of thy infant years!<br>
Yon foaming flood seems motionless as ice;<br>
Its dizzy turbulence eludes the eye,<br>
Frozen by distance; so, majestic Pile,<br>
To the perception of this Age, appear<br>
Thy fierce beginnings, softened and subdued<br>
And quieted in character&mdash;the strife,<br>
The pride, the fury uncontrollable,<br>
Lost on the aerial heights of the Crusades!"<br>

in making his quotation in 1827: August 31, 1803.</span>

 <blockquote> "When we had ascended half-way up the hill, directed by the man, I
  took a nearer foot-path, and at the top came in view of a most
  impressive scene, a ruined castle on an island almost in the middle of
  the last compartment of the lake, backed by a mountain cove, down
  which came a roaring stream. The castle occupied every foot of the
  island that was visible to us, appearing to rise out of the water;
  mists rested upon the mountain side, with spots of sunshine between;
  there was a mild desolation in the low grounds, a solemn grandeur in
  the mountains, and the castle was wild, yet stately, not dismantled of
  its turrets, nor the walls broken down, though completely in ruin.
  After having stood some minutes I joined William on the highroad, and
  both wishing to stay longer near this place, we requested the man to
  drive his little boy on to Dalmally, about two miles further, and
  leave the car at the inn. He told us the ruin was called Kilchurn
  Castle, that it belonged to Lord Breadalbane, and had been built by
  one of the ladies of that family for her defence, during her lord's
  absence at the Crusades; for which purpose she levied a tax of seven
  years' rent upon her tenants; he said that from that side of the lake
  it did not appear, in very dry weather, to stand upon an island, but
  that it was possible to go over to it without being wet-shod. We were
  very lucky in seeing it after a great flood; for its enchanting effect
  was chiefly owing to its situation in the lake, a decayed palace
  rising out of the plain of waters! I have called it a palace, for such
  feeling it gave me, though having been built as a place of defence, a
  castle or fortress. We turned again and reascended the hill, and sate
  a long time in the middle of it looking on the castle, and the huge
  mountain cove opposite, and William, addressing himself to the ruin,
  poured out these verses."</blockquote>

<h2><a name="section117"></a>Rob Roy's Grave</h2>

<h4>Composed between 1803 and 1805.&mdash;Published 1807</h4>

<a href="#section117a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
The History of Rob Roy is sufficiently known; his Grave is near the head
of Loch Ketterine, in one of those small Pin-fold-like Burial-grounds,
of neglected and desolate appearance, which the Traveller meets with in
the Highlands of Scotland. &mdash;W. W. 1807.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[I have since been told that I was misinformed as to the burial-place of
Rob Roy. If so, I may plead in excuse that I wrote on apparently good
authority, namely, that of a well educated Lady who lived at the head of
the Lake, within a mile or less of the point indicated as containing the
remains of One so famous in the neighbourhood.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">In the copy of <i>Rob Roy's Grave</i>, transcribed in Dorothy Wordsworth's
'Recollections' of the Tour in Scotland of 1803, there are several
important variations of text, which occur in none of the printed
editions of the poem. These are indicated (to distinguish them from
other readings) by the initials D. W.&mdash;Ed.<br>

<td>A famous man is Robin Hood,<br>
The English ballad-singer's joy!<br>
And Scotland has a thief as good,<br>
An outlaw of as daring mood;<br><br>

She has her brave<b> Rob Roy</b>!<br>
Then clear the weeds from off his Grave,<br>
And let us chant a passing stave,<br>
In honour of that Hero brave!<br><br>

Heaven gave Rob Roy a dauntless heart<br>
And wondrous length and strength of arm:<br>
Nor craved he more to quell his foes,<br>
  Or keep his friends from harm.<br><br>

Yet was Rob Roy as <i>wise</i> as brave;<br>
Forgive me if the phrase be strong;&mdash;<br>
A Poet worthy of Rob Roy<br>
  Must scorn a timid song.<br><br>

Say, then, that he was wise as brave;<br>
As wise in thought as bold in deed:<br>
For in the principles of things<br>
  <i>He</i> sought his moral creed.<br><br>

Said generous Rob, "What need of books?<br>
Burn all the statutes and their shelves:<br>
They stir us up against our kind;<br>
  And worse, against ourselves.<br><br>

"We have a passion&mdash;make a law,<br>
Too false to guide us or control!<br>
And for the law itself we fight<br>
  In bitterness of soul.<br><br>

"And, puzzled, blinded thus, we lose<br>
Distinctions that are plain and few:<br>
These find I graven on my heart:<br>
  <i>That</i> tells me what to do.<br><br>

"The creatures see of flood and field,<br>
And those that travel on the wind!<br>
With them no strife can last; they live <br>
  In peace, and peace of mind.<br><br>

"For why?&mdash;because the good old rule<br>
Sufficeth them, the simple plan,<br>
That they should take, who have the power,<br>
  And they should keep who can.<br><br>

"A lesson that is quickly learned,<br>
A signal this which all can see!<br>
Thus nothing here provokes the strong<br>
  To wanton cruelty.<br><br>

"All freakishness of mind is checked;<br>
He tamed, who foolishly aspires;<br>
While to the measure of his might<br>
  Each fashions his desires.<br><br>

"All kinds, and creatures, stand and fall<br>
By strength of prowess or of wit:<br>
'Tis God's appointment who must sway,<br>
  And who is to submit.<br><br>

"Since, then, the rule of right is plain,<br>
And longest life is but a day;<br>
To have my ends, maintain my rights,<br>
  I'll take the shortest way."<br><br>

And thus among these rocks he lived,<br>
Through summer heat and winter snow:<br>
The Eagle, he was lord above,<br>
  And Rob was lord below.<br><br>

So was it&mdash;<i>would</i>, at least, have been<br>
But through untowardness of fate;<br>
For Polity was then too strong&mdash;<br>
  He came an age too late;<br><br>

Or shall we say an age too soon?<br>
For, were the bold Man living <i>now</i>,<br>
How might he flourish in his pride,<br>
  With buds on every bough!<br><br>

Then rents and factors, rights of chase,<br>
Sheriffs, and lairds and their domains,<br>
Would all have seemed but paltry things,<br>
  Not worth a moment's pains.<br><br>

Rob Roy had never lingered here,<br>
To these few meagre Vales confined;<br>
But thought how wide the world, the times<br>
  How fairly to his mind!<br><br>

And to his Sword he would have said,<br>
"Do Thou my sovereign will enact<br>
From land to land through half the earth!<br>
  Judge thou of law and fact!<br><br>

"'Tis fit that we should do our part,<br>
Becoming, that mankind should learn<br>
That we are not to be surpassed<br>
  In fatherly concern.<br><br>

"Of old things all are over old, <br>
Of good things none are good enough:&mdash;<br>
We'll show that we can help to frame<br>
  A world of other stuff.<br><br>

"I, too, will have my kings that take<br>
From me the sign of life and death: <br>
Kingdoms shall shift about, like clouds,<br>
  Obedient to my breath."<br><br>

And, if the word had been fulfilled,<br>
As <i>might</i> have been, then, thought of joy!<br>
France would have had her present Boast,<br>
  And we our own Rob Roy!<br><br>

Oh! say not so; compare them not;<br>
I would not wrong thee, Champion brave!<br>
Would wrong thee nowhere; least of all<br>
  Here standing by thy grave. <br><br>

For Thou, although with some wild thoughts<br>
Wild Chieftain of a savage Clan!<br>
Hadst this to boast of; thou didst love<br>
  The <i>liberty</i> of man.<br><br>

And, had it been thy lot to live<br>
With us who now behold the light,<br>
Thou would'st have nobly stirred thyself,<br>
  And battled for the Right.<br><br>

For thou wert still the poor man's stay,<br>
The poor man's heart, the poor man's hand;<br>
And all the oppressed, who wanted strength,<br>
  Had thine at their command.<br><br>

Bear witness many a pensive sigh<br>
Of thoughtful Herdsman when he strays<br>
Alone upon Loch Veol's heights,<br>
  And by Loch Lomond's braes!<br><br>

And, far and near, through vale and hill,<br>
Are faces that attest the same;<br>
The proud heart flashing through the eyes,<br>
  At sound of <b>Rob Roy's</b> name.<br>

could garter his Tartan Stockings below the knee when standing upright."
According to their account he was a tremendous Swordsman; after having
sought all occasions of proving his prowess, he was never conquered but
once, and this not till he was an Old Man.&mdash;W. W. 1807.<br>

<a name="117n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp;<span style="color: #555555;"> In Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Recollections</i> of the Scotch Tour the
following occurs:</span>

<blockquote>"August 27, 1803.&mdash;We mentioned Rob Roy, and the eyes
of all glistened; even the lady of the house, who was very diffident,
and no great talker, exclaimed, 'He was a good man, Rob Roy! he had been
dead only about eighty years, had lived in the next farm, which belonged
to him, and there his bones were laid.' He was a famous swordsman.
Having an arm much longer than other men, he had a greater command with
his sword. As a proof of the length of his arm, they told us that he
could garter his tartan stockings below the knee without stooping, and
added a dozen different stories of single combats, which he had fought,
all in perfect good humour, merely to prove his prowess. I daresay they
had stories of this kind which would hardly have been exhausted in the
long evenings of a whole December week, Rob Roy being as famous here as
even Robin Hood was in the forest of Sherwood; <i>he</i> also robbed
from the rich, giving to the poor, and defending them from oppression.
They tell of his confining the factor of the Duke of Montrose in one of
the islands of Loch Ketterine, after having taken his money from
him&mdash;the Duke's rents&mdash;in open day, while they were sitting at table. He
was a formidable enemy of the Duke, but being a small laird against a
greater, was overcome at last, and forced to resign all his lands on the
Braes of Loch Lomond, including the caves which we visited, on account
of the money he had taken from the Duke and could not repay."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">September 12:</span>

  <blockquote>"Descended into Glengyle, above Loch Ketterine, and passed through Mr.
  Macfarlane's grounds, that is, through the whole of the glen, where
  there was now no house left but his. We stopped at his door to inquire
  after the family, though with little hope of finding them at home,
  having seen a large company at work in a hay-field, whom we
  conjectured to be his whole household, as it proved, except a
  servant-maid who answered our enquiries. We had sent the ferryman
  forward from the head of the glen to bring the boat round from the
  place where he left it to the other side of the lake. Passed the same
  farm-house we had such good reason to remember, and went up to the
  burying-ground that stood so sweetly near the water-side. The ferryman
  had told us that Rob Roy's grave was there, so we could not pass on
  without going up to the spot. There were several tombstones, but the
  inscriptions were either worn-out or unintelligible to us, and the
  place choked up with nettles and brambles. You will remember the
  description I have given of the spot. I have nothing here to add,
  except the following poem which it suggested to William."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Rob Roy was buried at the Kirkton of Balquhidder, near the outlet of
Loch Voil in Perthshire. There are three sculptured stones in the rude
burial-place of the Macgregors, at the eastern end of the old church.
The one with the long claymore marks the resting-place of Rob Roy's
wife; the one opposite on the other side is the tomb of his eldest son;
and the central stone, more elaborately carved, marks the grave of the
hero himself.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

  Neidpath Castle, about a mile and a half from the town. The castle
  stands upon a green hill, over-looking the Tweed, a strong
  square-towered edifice, neglected and desolate, though not in ruin,
  the garden overgrown with grass, and the high walls that fenced it
  broken down. The Tweed winds between green steeps, upon which, and
  close to the river side, large flocks of sheep pasturing; higher still
  are the grey mountains; but I need not describe the scene, for William
  has done it better than I could do in a sonnet which he wrote the same

  more of the feeling of the place than it would be possible for me to

<td>From Stirling castle we had seen<br>
The mazy Forth unravelled;<br>
Had trod the banks of Clyde, and Tay,<br>
And with the Tweed had travelled;<br>
And when we came to Clovenford, <br>
Then said my "<i>winsome Marrow</i>,"<br>
"Whate'er betide, we'll turn aside,<br>
And see the Braes of Yarrow."<br><br>

"Let Yarrow folk, <i>frae</i> Selkirk town,<br>
Who have been buying, selling, <br>
Go back to Yarrow, 'tis their own;<br>
Each maiden to her dwelling!<br>
On Yarrow's banks let herons feed,<br>
Hares couch, and rabbits burrow!<br>
But we will downward with the Tweed, <br>
Nor turn aside to Yarrow.<br>
 <br>
"There's Galla Water, Leader Haughs,<br>
Both lying right before us;<br>
And Dryborough, where with chiming Tweed<br>
The lintwhites sing in chorus;<br>
There's pleasant Tiviot-dale, a land<br>
Made blithe with plough and harrow:<br>
Why throw away a needful day<br>
To go in search of Yarrow?<br><br>

"What's Yarrow but a river bare,<br>
That glides the dark hills under?<br>
There are a thousand such elsewhere<br>
As worthy of your wonder."<br>
&mdash;Strange words they seemed of slight and scorn;<br>
My True-love sighed for sorrow;<br>
And looked me in the face, to think<br>
I thus could speak of Yarrow!<br><br>

"Oh! green," said I, "are Yarrow's holms,<br>
And sweet is Yarrow flowing!<br>
Fair hangs the apple frae the rock,<br>
But we will leave it growing.<br>
O'er hilly path, and open Strath,<br>
We'll wander Scotland thorough;<br>
But, though so near, we will not turn<br>
Into the dale of Yarrow.<br><br>

"Let beeves and home-bred kine partake<br>
The sweets of Burn-mill meadow;<br>
The swan on still St. Mary's Lake<br>
Float double, swan and shadow!<br>
We will not see them; will not go,<br>
To-day, nor yet to-morrow;<br>
Enough if in our hearts we know<br>
There's such a place as Yarrow.<br><br>

"Be Yarrow stream unseen, unknown!<br>
It must, or we shall rue it:<br>
We have a vision of our own;<br>
Ah! why should we undo it?<br>
The treasured dreams of times long past,<br>
We'll keep them, winsome Marrow!<br>
For when we're there, although 'tis fair,<br>
'Twill be another Yarrow.<br><br>

"If Care with freezing years should come,<br>
And wandering seem but folly,&mdash;<br>
Should we be loth to stir from home,<br>
And yet be melancholy;<br>
Should life be dull, and spirits low,<br>
'Twill soothe us in our sorrow,<br>
That earth has something yet to show,<br>
The bonny holms of Yarrow!"<br>

reports a conversation, in which the poet said to him, </span>

  <blockquote>"Scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on <i>Yarrow</i>, He makes
  me write,

   <blockquote> 'The swans on sweet St. Mary's Lake<br>
    Float double, swans and shadow;'</blockquote>

  but I wrote,

    <blockquote>'The <i>swan</i> on <i>still</i> St. Mary's Lake.'</blockquote>

  Never could I have written 'swans' in the plural. The scene when I saw
  it, with its still and dim lake, under the dusky hills, was one of
  utter loneliness: there was <i>one</i> swan, and one only, stemming the
  water, and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to
  the one companion of that swan, its own white image in the water. It
  was for that reason that I recorded the Swan and the Shadow. Had there
  been many swans and many shadows, they would have implied nothing as
  regards the character of the place; and I should have said nothing
  about them."</blockquote>
  
<span style="color: #555555;">See his <i>Essays, chiefly on Poetry</i>, vol. ii. p. 277.<br>
<br>
Wordsworth wrote to his friend, Walter Scott, to thank him for a copy of
<i>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</i>, and in return sent a copy of these
stanzas, <i>Yarrow Unvisited</i>. Scott replied gratefully on the 16th March
1805, and said,</span>

  <blockquote>"... I by no means admit your apology, however ingeniously and
  artfully stated, for not visiting the bonny holms of Yarrow, and
  certainly will not rest till I have prevailed upon you to compare the
  ideal with the real stream."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Wordsworth had asked him if he could suggest any name more true to the
place than Burnmill, in the line, "The sweets of Burn-mill meadow."
Scott replied:</span>

 <blockquote> "We have Broad-meadow upon Yarrow, which with the addition of green or
  fair or any other epithet of one syllable, will give truth to the
  locality, and supply the place of Burnmill meadow, which we have not.
  ... I like your swan upon St. Mary's Lake. How came you to know that
  it is actually frequented by that superb bird?"</blockquote>

  mile and a half or two miles of Clovenford, where we were to lodge.
  Turned up the side of a hill, and went along sheep-grounds till we
  reached the spot&mdash;a single stone house, without a tree near it or to
  be seen from it. On our mentioning Mr. Scott's name, the woman of the
  house showed us all possible civility, but her slowness was really
  amusing. I should suppose it a house little frequented, for there is
  no appearance of an inn. Mr. Scott, who she told me was a very clever
  gentleman, 'goes there in the fishing season;' but indeed Mr. Scott is
  respected everywhere; I believe that by favour of his name one might
  be hospitably entertained throughout all the borders of Scotland. We
  dined and drank tea&mdash;did not walk out, for there was no temptation; a
  confined barren prospect from the window.<br>
<br>
  "At Clovenford, being so near to the Yarrow, we could not but think of

<td>Age! twine thy brows with fresh spring flowers,<br>
And call a train of laughing Hours;<br>
And bid them dance, and bid them sing;<br>
And thou, too, mingle in the ring!<br>
Take to thy heart a new delight;<br>
If not, make merry in despite<br>
That there is One who scorns thy power:&mdash;<br>
But dance! for under Jedborough Tower,<br>
A Matron dwells who, though she bears<br>
The weight of more than seventy years,<br>
Lives in the light of youthful glee,<br>
And she will dance and sing with thee.<br><br>

  Nay! start not at that Figure&mdash;there!<br>
Him who is rooted to his chair!<br>
Look at him&mdash;look again! for he<br>
Hath long been of thy family.<br>
With legs that move not, if they can,<br>
And useless arms, a trunk of man,<br>
He sits, and with a vacant eye;<br>
A sight to make a stranger sigh!<br>
Deaf, drooping, that is now his doom:<br>
His world is in this single room:<br>
Is this a place for mirthful cheer?<br>
Can merry-making enter here?<br><br>

  The joyous Woman is the Mate <br>
Of him in that forlorn estate!<br>
He breathes a subterraneous damp;<br>
But bright as Vesper shines her lamp:<br>
He is as mute as Jedborough Tower:<br>
She jocund as it was of yore,<br>
With all its bravery on; in times<br>
When all alive with merry chimes,<br>
Upon a sun-bright morn of May,<br>
It roused the Vale to holiday.<br><br>

  I praise thee, Matron! and thy due <br>
Is praise, heroic praise, and true! <br>
With admiration I behold<br>
Thy gladness unsubdued and bold:<br>
Thy looks, thy gestures, all present<br>
The picture of a life well spent:<br>
This do I see; and something more;<br>
A strength unthought of heretofore!<br>
Delighted am I for thy sake;<br>
And yet a higher joy partake:<br>
Our Human-nature throws away<br>
Its second twilight, and looks gay;<br>
A land of promise and of pride<br>
Unfolding, wide as life is wide.<br><br>

  Ah! see her helpless Charge! enclosed<br>
Within himself as seems, composed; <br>
To fear of loss, and hope of gain,<br>
The strife of happiness and pain,<br>
Utterly dead! yet in the guise<br>
Of little infants, when their eyes<br>
Begin to follow to and fro<br>
The persons that before them go,<br>
He tracks her motions, quick or slow.<br>
Her buoyant spirit can prevail<br>
Where common cheerfulness would fail;<br>
She strikes upon him with the heat<br>
Of July suns; he feels it sweet;<br>
An animal delight though dim!<br>
'Tis all that now remains for him!<br><br>

  The more I looked, I wondered more&mdash;<br>
And, while I scanned them o'er and o'er,<br>
Some inward trouble suddenly<br>
Broke from the Matron's strong black eye&mdash;<br>
A remnant of uneasy light,<br>
A flash of something over-bright!<br>
Nor long this mystery did detain <br>
My thoughts;&mdash;she told in pensive strain<br>
That she had borne a heavy yoke,<br>
Been stricken by a twofold stroke;<br>
Ill health of body; and had pined<br>
Beneath worse ailments of the mind. <br><br>

  So be it!&mdash;but let praise ascend<br>
To Him who is our lord and friend!<br>
Who from disease and suffering<br>
Hath called for thee a second spring;<br>
Repaid thee for that sore distress<br>
By no untimely joyousness;<br>
Which makes of thine a blissful state;<br>
And cheers thy melancholy Mate!<br>

 <blockquote> "We were received with hearty welcome by a good woman, who, though
  above seventy years old, moved about as briskly as if she was only
  seventeen. Those parts of the house which we were to occupy were neat
  and clean; she showed me every corner, and, before I had been ten
  minutes in the house, opened her very drawers that I might see what a
  stock of linen she had; then asked how long we should stay, and said
  she wished we were come for three months. She was a most remarkable
  person; the alacrity with which she ran up-stairs when we rung the
  bell, and guessed at, and strove to prevent, our wants was surprising;
  she had a quick eye, and keen strong features, and a joyousness in her
  motions, like what used to be in old Molly when she was particularly
  elated. I found afterwards that she had been subject to fits of
  dejection and ill-health: we then conjectured that her overflowing
  gaiety and strength might in part be attributed to the same cause as
  her former dejection. Her husband was deaf and infirm, and sate in a
  chair with scarcely the power to move a limb&mdash;an affecting contrast!
  The old woman said they had been a very hard-working pair; they had
  wrought like slaves at their trade&mdash;her husband had been a currier;
  and she told me how they had portioned off their daughters with money,
  and each a feather bed, and that in their old age they had laid out
  the little they could spare in building and furnishing that house, and
  she added with pride that she had lived in her youth in the family of
  Lady Egerton, who was no high lady, and now was in the habit of coming
  to her house whenever she was at Jedburgh, and a hundred other things;
  for when she once began with Lady Egerton, she did not know how to
  stop, nor did I wish it, for she was very entertaining. Mr. Scott sat
  with us an hour or two, and repeated a part of the <i>Lay of the Last
  Minstrel</i>. When he was gone our hostess came to see if we wanted
  anything, and to wish us good-night. On all occasions her manners were
  governed by the same spirit: there was no withdrawing one's attention
  from her. We were so much interested that William, long afterwards,
  thought it worth while to express in verse the sensations which she
  had excited, and which then remained as vividly in his mind as at the
  moment when we lost sight of Jedburgh."</blockquote>

<td>Now we are tired of boisterous joy,<br>
Have romped enough, my little Boy!<br>
Jane hangs her head upon my breast,<br>
And you shall bring your stool and rest;<br>
  This corner is your own.<br><br>

There! take your seat, and let me see<br>
That you can listen quietly:<br>
And, as I promised, I will tell<br>
That strange adventure which befel<br>
  A poor blind Highland Boy.<br><br>

A <i>Highland</i> Boy!&mdash;why call him so?<br>
Because, my Darlings, ye must know<br>
That, under hills which rise like towers,<br>
Far higher hills than these of ours!<br>
  He from his birth had lived.<br><br>

He ne'er had seen one earthly sight<br>
The sun, the day; the stars, the night;<br>
Or tree, or butterfly, or flower,<br>
Or fish in stream, or bird in bower,<br>
  Or woman, man, or child.<br><br>

And yet he neither drooped nor pined,<br>
Nor had a melancholy mind;<br>
For God took pity on the Boy,<br>
And was his friend; and gave him joy<br>
  Of which we nothing know. <br><br>

His Mother, too, no doubt, above<br>
Her other children him did love:<br>
For, was she here, or was she there,<br>
She thought of him with constant care,<br>
  And more than mother's love.<br><br>

And proud she was of heart, when clad<br>
In crimson stockings, tartan plaid,<br>
And bonnet with a feather gay,<br>
To Kirk he on the sabbath day<br>
  Went hand in hand with her.<br><br>

A dog too, had he; not for need,<br>
But one to play with and to feed;<br>
Which would have led him, if bereft<br>
Of company or friends, and left<br>
  Without a better guide.<br><br>

And then the bagpipes he could blow&mdash;<br>
And thus from house to house would go;<br>
And all were pleased to hear and see,<br>
For none made sweeter melody<br>
  Than did the poor blind Boy.<br><br>

Yet he had many a restless dream;<br>
Both when he heard the eagles scream,<br>
And when he heard the torrents roar,<br>
And heard the water beat the shore<br>
  Near which their cottage stood.<br><br>

Beside a lake their cottage stood,<br>
Not small like ours, a peaceful flood;<br>
But one of mighty size, and strange;<br>
That, rough or smooth, is full of change,<br>
  And stirring in its bed. <br><br>

For to this lake, by night and day,<br>
The great Sea-water finds its way<br>
Through long, long windings of the hills<br>
And drinks up all the pretty rills<br>
  And rivers large and strong:<br><br>

Then hurries back the road it came&mdash;<br>
Returns, on errand still the same;<br>
This did it when the earth was new;<br>
And this for evermore will do,<br>
  As long as earth shall last. <br><br>

And, with the coming of the tide,<br>
Come boats and ships that safely ride<br>
Between the woods and lofty rocks;<br>
And to the shepherds with their flocks<br>
Bring tales of distant lands.<br><br>

And of those tales, whate'er they were,<br>
The blind Boy always had his share;<br>
Whether of mighty towns, or vales<br>
With warmer suns and softer gales,<br>
    Or wonders of the Deep.<br><br>

Yet more it pleased him, more it stirred,<br>
When from the water-side he heard<br>
The shouting, and the jolly cheers;<br>
The bustle of the mariners<br>
    In stillness or in storm.<br><br>

But what do his desires avail?<br>
For He must never handle sail;<br>
Nor mount the mast, nor row, nor float<br>
In sailor's ship, or fisher's boat,<br>
    Upon the rocking waves.<br><br>

His Mother often thought, and said,<br>
What sin would be upon her head<br>
If she should suffer this: "My Son,<br>
Whate'er you do, leave this undone;<br>
    The danger is so great."<br><br>

Thus lived he by Loch-Leven's side<br>
Still sounding with the sounding tide,<br>
And heard the billows leap and dance,<br>
Without a shadow of mischance,<br>
    Till he was ten years old.<br><br>

When one day (and now mark me well,<br>
Ye soon shall know how this befell)<br>
He in a vessel of his own,<br>
On the swift flood is hurrying down,<br>
    Down to the mighty Sea.<br><br>

In such a vessel never more<br>
May human creature leave the Shore!<br>
If this or that way he should stir,<br>
Woe to the poor blind Mariner!<br>
  For death will be his doom.<br>
<br>
But say what bears him?&mdash;Ye have seen<br>
The Indian's bow, his arrows keen,<br>
Rare beasts, and birds with plumage bright;<br>
Gifts which, for wonder or delight,<br>
  Are brought in ships from far.<br><br>

Such gifts had those seafaring men<br>
Spread round that haven in the glen;<br>
Each hut, perchance, might have its own;<br>
And to the Boy they all were known&mdash;<br>
   He knew and prized them all.<br><br>

The rarest was a Turtle-shell<br>
Which he, poor Child, had studied well;<br>
A shell of ample size, and light<br>
As the pearly car of Amphitrite,<br>
  That sportive dolphins drew.<br><br>

And, as a Coracle that braves<br>
On Vaga's breast the fretful waves,<br>
This shell upon the deep would swim,<br>
And gaily lift its fearless brim<br>
  Above the tossing surge.<br><br>

And this the little blind Boy knew:<br>
And he a story strange yet true<br>
Had heard, how in a shell like this<br>
An English Boy, O thought of bliss!<br>
  Had stoutly launched from shore;<br><br>

Launched from the margin of a bay<br>
Among the Indian isles, where lay<br>
His father's ship, and had sailed far&mdash;<br>
To join that gallant ship of war,<br>
  In his delightful shell.<br><br>

Our Highland Boy oft visited<br>
'The house that held this prize; and, led<br>
By choice or chance, did thither come<br>
One day when no one was at home,<br>
  And found the door unbarred.<br><br>

While there he sate, alone and blind,<br>
That story flashed upon his mind;&mdash;<br>
A bold thought roused him, and he took<br>
The shell from out its secret nook,<br>
   And bore it on his head.<br><br>

He launched his vessel,&mdash;and in pride<br>
Of spirit, from Loch-Leven's side,<br>
Stepped into it&mdash;his thoughts all free<br>
As the light breezes that with glee<br>
   Sang through the adventurer's hair.<br><br>

A while he stood upon his feet;<br>
He felt the motion&mdash;took his seat;<br>
Still better pleased as more and more<br>
The tide retreated from the shore,<br>
   And sucked, and sucked him in.<br><br>

And there he is in face of Heaven.<br>
How rapidly the Child is driven!<br>
The fourth part of a mile, I ween,<br>
He thus had gone, ere he was seen<br>
   By any human eye.<br><br>

But when he was first seen, oh me<br>
What shrieking and what misery!<br>
For many saw; among the rest<br>
His Mother, she who loved him best,<br>
  She saw her poor blind Boy.<br><br>

But for the child, the sightless Boy,<br>
It is the triumph of his joy!<br>
The bravest traveller in balloon,<br>
Mounting as if to reach the moon,<br>
  Was never half so blessed. <br><br>

And let him, let him go his way,<br>
Alone, and innocent, and gay!<br>
For, if good Angels love to wait<br>
On the forlorn unfortunate,<br>
  This Child will take no harm.<br><br>

But now the passionate lament,<br>
Which from the crowd on shore was sent,<br>
The cries which broke from old and young<br>
In Gaelic, or the English tongue,<br>
  Are stifled&mdash;all is still.<br><br>

And quickly with a silent crew<br>
A boat is ready to pursue;<br>
And from the shore their course they take,<br>
And swiftly down the running lake<br>
  They follow the blind Boy.<br><br>

But soon they move with softer pace;<br>
So have ye seen the fowler chase<br>
On Grasmere's clear unruffled breast<br>
A youngling of the wild-duck's nest<br>
  With deftly-lifted oar; <br><br>

Or as the wily sailors crept<br>
To seize (while on the Deep it slept)<br>
The hapless creature which did dwell<br>
Erewhile within the dancing shell,<br>
  They steal upon their prey.<br><br>

With sound the least that can be made,<br>
They follow, more and more afraid,<br>
More cautious as they draw more near;<br>
But in his darkness he can hear,<br>
  And guesses their intent.<br><br>

"<i>Lei-gha&mdash;Lei-gha</i>"&mdash;he then cried out,<br>
"<i>Lei-gha&mdash;Lei-gha</i>"&mdash;with eager shout;<br>
Thus did he cry, and thus did pray,<br>
And what he meant was, "Keep away,<br>
  And leave me to myself!"<br><br>

Alas! and when he felt their hands&mdash;<br>
You've often heard of magic wands,<br>
That with a motion overthrow<br>
A palace of the proudest show,<br>
  Or melt it into air:<br><br>

So all his dreams&mdash;that inward light<br>
With which his soul had shone so bright&mdash;<br>
All vanished;&mdash;'twas a heartfelt cross<br>
To him, a heavy, bitter loss,<br>
  As he had ever known.<br><br>

But hark! a gratulating voice,<br>
With which the very hills rejoice:<br>
'Tis from the crowd, who tremblingly<br>
Have watched the event, and now can see<br>
  That he is safe at last.<br><br>

And then, when he was brought to land,<br>
Full sure they were a happy band,<br>
Which, gathering round, did on the banks<br>
Of that great Water give God thanks,<br>
  And welcomed the poor Child. <br><br>

And in the general joy of heart<br>
The blind Boy's little dog took part;<br>
He leapt about, and oft did kiss<br>
His master's hands in sign of bliss,<br>
  With sound like lamentation.<br><br>

But most of all, his Mother dear,<br>
She who had fainted with her fear,<br>
Rejoiced when waking she espies<br>
The Child; when she can trust her eyes,<br>
  And touches the blind Boy.<br><br>

She led him home, and wept amain,<br>
When he was in the house again:<br>
Tears flowed in torrents from her eyes;<br>
She kissed him&mdash;how could she chastise?<br>
  She was too happy far.<br><br>

Thus, after he had fondly braved<br>
The perilous Deep, the Boy was saved;<br>
And, though his fancies had been wild,<br>
Yet he was pleased and reconciled<br>
  To live in peace on shore. <br><br>

And in the lonely Highland dell<br>
Still do they keep the Turtle-shell;<br>
And long the story will repeat<br>
Of the blind Boy's adventurous feat,<br>
  And how he was preserved.<br>

whose MS. was not specially clear, may have written, or meant to write
"petty," (a much better word), and not perceived the mistake when
revising the sheets. If he really wrote "petty," he may have meant
either small rills (rillets), or used the word as Shakespeare used it,
for "pelting" rills.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

Wordsworth sent him this stanza of the poem, and asked</span>

  <blockquote>"Could you furnish me, by application to any of your Gaelic friends, a
  phrase in that language which could take its place in the following
  verse of eight syllables, and have the following meaning." </blockquote>

<a name="122n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; It is recorded in Dampier's Voyages that a Boy, the Son of a Captain of
a Man of War, seated himself in a Turtle-shell and floated in it from
the shore to his Father's Ship, which lay at anchor at the distance of
half a mile. Upon the suggestion of a Friend, I have substituted such a
Shell for that less elegant vessel in which my blind voyager did
actually intrust himself to the dangerous current of Loch Levin, as was
related to me by an Eye-witness.&mdash;W. W. 1815.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">This note varies slightly in later editions.<br>
<br>
The Loch Leven referred to is a sea-loch in Argyllshire, into which the
tidal water flows with some force from Loch Linnhe at Ballachulish.</span>
            
           <blockquote> 'By night and day<br>
  The great Sea-water finds its way<br>
  Through long, long windings of the hills.'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The friend referred to in the note of 1815, who urged Wordsworth to give
his blind voyager a Shell, instead of a washing-tub to sail in, was
Coleridge. The original tale of the tub was not more unfortunate than
the lines in praise of Wilkinson's spade, and several of Wordsworth's
friends, notably Charles Lamb and Barren Field, objected to the change.
Lamb wrote to Wordsworth in 1815,</span>

 <blockquote> "I am afraid lest that substitution of a shell (a flat falsification
  of the history) for the household implement, as it stood at first, was
  a kind of tub thrown out to the beast" [<i>i. e.</i> the reviewer!] "or
  rather thrown out for him. The tub was a good honest tub in its place,
  and nothing could fairly be said against it. You say you made the
  alteration for the 'friendly reader,' but the 'malicious' will take it
  to himself."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">(<i>The Letters of Charles Lamb</i>, edited by Alfred Ainger, vol. i. p.
283.) Wordsworth could not be induced to "undo his work," and go back to
his own original; although he evidently agreed with what Lamb had said
(as is seen in a letter to Barren Field, Oct. 24, 1828).&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<td>Six thousand veterans practised in war's game,<br>
Tried men, at Killicranky were arrayed<br>
Against an equal host that wore the plaid,<br>
Shepherds and herdsmen.&mdash;Like a whirlwind came<br>
The Highlanders, the slaughter spread like flame; <br>
And Garry, thundering down his mountain-road,<br>
Was stopped, and could not breathe beneath the load<br>
Of the dead bodies.&mdash;'Twas a day of shame<br>
For them whom precept and the pedantry<br>
Of cold mechanic battle do enslave.<br>

Who on that day the word of onset gave!<br>
Like conquest would the Men of England see;<br>
And her Foes find a like inglorious grave.<br>

<a name="129n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">The following is from Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Recollections of a Tour made
in Scotland</i>, 1803:</span>

  <blockquote>"Thursday, September 8th.&mdash;Before breakfast we walked to the Pass of
  Killicrankie. A very fine scene; the river Garry forcing its way down
  a deep chasm between rocks, at the foot of high rugged hills covered
  with wood, to a great height. The pass did not, however, impress us
  with awe, or a sensation of difficulty or danger, according to our
  expectations; but, the road being at a considerable height on the side
  of the hill, we at first only looked into the dell or chasm. It is
  much grander seen from below, near the river's bed. Everybody knows
  that this Pass is famous in military history. When we were travelling
  in Scotland, an invasion was hourly looked for, and one could not but
  think with some regret of the times when, from the now depopulated
  Highlands forty or fifty thousand men might have been poured down for
  the defence of the country, under such leaders as the Marquis of
  Montrose or the brave man who had so distinguished himself upon the
  ground where we were standing. I will transcribe a sonnet suggested to
  William by this place, and written in Oct. 1803."</blockquote>

<a name="130n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">This sonnet, as the title indicates, does not refer to an actual
victory; because, since the Norman conquest, no "Invaders" have ever set
foot "on British ground." It was written&mdash;like the two preceding
sonnets, and the one that follows it&mdash;"in anticipation" of Napoleon's
project for the invasion of England being actually carried out; a
project never realised. The assembling of the immense French army
destined for this purpose&mdash;one of the finest brought together since the
days of the Roman legions&mdash;between the mouths of the Seine and the
Texel, roused the spirit of English patriotism as it had never been
roused before. Three hundred thousand volunteers were enlisted in Great
Britain by the 10th of August 1803;</span>

  <blockquote>"all the male population of the kingdom from seventeen years of age to
  fifty-five were divided into classes to be successively armed and
  exercised" (Dyer).</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The story of the failure of Napoleon's scheme is too well known to be
repeated in this note. Wordsworth seems to have written his sonnet in
anticipation of what he believed would have been the inevitable issue of
events, had the French army actually landed on British soil.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>
