<span style="color: #555555;">Towards the close of December 1799, Wordsworth came to live at Dove
Cottage, Town-end, Grasmere. The poems written during the following year
(1800), are more particularly associated with that district of the
Lakes. Two of them were fragments of a canto of <i>The Recluse</i>, entitled
"Home at Grasmere," referring to his settlement at Dove Cottage. Others,
such as <i>Michael</i>, and <i>The Brothers</i>&mdash;classed by him afterwards among
the "Poems founded on the Affections,"&mdash;deal with incidents in the rural
life of the dalesmen of Westmoreland and Cumberland. Most of the "Poems
on the Naming of Places" were written during this year; and the "Places"
are all in the neighbourhood of Grasmere. To these were added several
"Pastoral Poems"&mdash;such as <i>The Idle Shepherd Boys; or, Dungeon-Ghyll
Force</i>&mdash;sundry "Poems of the Fancy," and one or two "Inscriptions." In
all, twenty-five poems were written in the year 1800; and, with the
exception of the two fragments of <i>The Recluse</i>, they were published
during the same year in the second volume of the second edition of
"Lyrical Ballads." It is impossible to fix the precise date of the
composition of the fragments of <i>The Recluse</i>; but, as they refer to the
settlement at Dove Cottage&mdash;where Wordsworth went to reside with his
sister, on the 21st of December 1799&mdash;they may fitly introduce the poems
belonging to the year 1800. They were first published in 1851 in the
<i>Memoirs of Wordsworth</i> (vol. i. pp. 157 and 155 respectively), by the
poet's nephew, the late Bishop of Lincoln. The entire canto of <i>The
Recluse</i>, entitled "Home at Grasmere," will be included in this edition.<br>
<br>
The first two poems which follow, as belonging to the year 1800, are
parts of <i>The Recluse</i>, viz. "On Nature's invitation do I come," (which
is ll. 71-97, and 110-125), and "Bleak season was it, turbulent and
bleak," (which is ll. 152-167). They are not reprinted from the
<i>Memoirs</i> of 1851, because the text there given was, in several
instances, inaccurately reproduced from the original MS., which has been
re-examined. They were printed here, in <i>The Recluse</i>(1888), and in my
<i>Life of Wordsworth</i> (vol. i. 1889).&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<td>On Nature's invitation do I come,                              <br>
By Reason sanctioned. Can the choice mislead,<br>
That made the calmest, fairest spot of earth,<br>
With all its unappropriated good,<br>
My own, and not mine only, for with me                          <br>
Entrenched&mdash;say rather peacefully embowered&mdash;<br>
Under yon orchard, in yon humble cot,<br>
A younger orphan of a home extinct,<br>
The only daughter of my parents dwells:<br>
Aye, think on that, my heart, and cease to stir;               <br>
Pause upon that, and let the breathing frame<br>
No longer breathe, but all be satisfied.<br>
Oh, if such silence be not thanks to God<br>
For what hath been bestowed, then where, where then<br>
Shall gratitude find rest? Mine eyes did ne'er                 <br>
Fix on a lovely object, nor my mind<br>
Take pleasure in the midst of happy thoughts,<br>
But either she, whom now I have, who now<br>
Divides with me this loved abode, was there,<br>
Or not far off. Where'er my footsteps turned,                  <br>
Her voice was like a hidden bird that sang;<br>
The thought of her was like a flash of light<br>
Or an unseen companionship, a breath<br>
Or fragrance independent of the wind.<br>
In all my goings, in the new and old                           <br>
Of all my meditations, and in this<br>
Favourite of all, in this the most of all....<br>
Embrace me then, ye hills, and close me in.<br>
Now in the clear and open day I feel<br>
Your guardianship: I take it to my heart;                      <br>
'Tis like the solemn shelter of the night.<br>
But I would call thee beautiful; for mild,<br>
And soft, and gay, and beautiful thou art,<br>
Dear valley, having in thy face a smile,<br>
Though peaceful, full of gladness. Thou art pleased,           <br>
Pleased with thy crags, and woody steeps, thy lake,<br>
Its one green island, and its winding shores,<br>
The multitude of little rocky hills,<br>
Thy church, and cottages of mountain-stone<br>
Clustered like stars some few, but single most,                <br>
And lurking dimly in their shy retreats,<br>
Or glancing at each other cheerful looks,<br>
Like separated stars with clouds between.<br>

<a name="26n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp;<span style="color: #555555;"> This Grasmere cottage is identified, much more than Rydal Mount, with
Wordsworth's "poetic prime." It had once been a public-house, bearing
the sign of the Dove and Olive Bough&mdash;and as such is referred to in
<i>The Waggoner</i>&mdash;from which circumstance it was for a long time, and
is now usually, called "Dove Cottage." A small two storied house, it is
described somewhat minutely&mdash;as it was in Wordsworth's time&mdash;by De
Quincey, in his <i>Recollections of the Lakes</i>, and by the late
Bishop of Lincoln, in the <i>Memoirs</i> of his <a name="fr26A">uncle.</a> </span>

  <blockquote>"The front of it
faces the lake; behind is a small plot of orchard and garden ground, in
which there is a spring and rocks; the enclosure shelves upwards towards
the woody sides of the mountains above it."<a href="#26A"><sup>A</sup></a> </blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The following is De
Quincey's description <a name="fr26B">of</a> it, as he saw it in the summer of 1807. </span>

<blockquote>"A white cottage, with two yew trees breaking the glare of its white
  walls" (these yews still stand on the eastern side of the cottage). "A
  little semi-vestibule between two doors prefaced the entrance into
  what might be considered the principal room of the cottage. It was an
  oblong square, not above eight and a half feet high, sixteen feet
  long, and twelve broad; wainscoted from floor to ceiling with dark
  polished oak, slightly embellished with carving. One window there
  was&mdash;a perfect and unpretending cottage window, with little diamond
  panes, embowered at almost every season of the year with roses; and,
  in the summer and autumn, with a profusion of jasmine, and other
  fragrant shrubs.... I was ushered up a little flight of stairs,
  fourteen in all, to a little drawing-room, or whatever the reader
  chooses to call it. Wordsworth himself has described the fireplace of
  this room as his

    <blockquote>'Half-kitchen and half-parlour fire.'</blockquote>

  It was not fully seven feet six inches high, and in other respects
  pretty nearly of the same dimensions as the rustic hall below. There
  was, however, in a small recess, a library of perhaps three hundred
  volumes, which seemed to consecrate the room as the poet's study and
  composing room, and such occasionally it was. But far oftener he both
  studied, as I found, and composed on the high road."<a href="#26B"><sup>B</sup></a></blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Other poems of later years refer, much more fully than the above, to
this cottage, and its orchard ground, where so many of Wordsworth's
lyrics were composed.<br>
<br>
The "orchard ground," which was for the most part in grass, sloped
upwards; but a considerable portion of the natural rock was exposed; and
on its face, some rough stone steps were cut by Wordsworth, helped by a
near neighbour of his&mdash;John Fisher&mdash;so as more conveniently to reach the
upper terrace, where the poet built for himself a small arbour. All this
garden and orchard ground is not much altered since 1800. The short
terrace walk is curved, with a sloping bank of grass above, shaded by
apple trees, hazel, holly, laburnum, laurel, and mountain ash. Below the
terrace is the well, which supplied the cottage in Wordsworth's time;
and there large leaved primroses still grow, doubtless the successors of
those planted by his own and his sister's hands. Above, and amongst the
rocks, are the daffodils, which they also brought to their
"garden-ground;" the Christmas roses, which they planted near the well,
were removed to the eastern side of the garden, where they flourished
luxuriantly in 1882; but have now, alas! disappeared. The box-wood
planted by the poet grows close to the cottage. The arbour is now gone;
but, in the place where it stood, a seat is erected. The hidden brook
still sings its under-song, as it used to do, "its quiet soul on all
bestowing," and the green linnet may doubtless be seen now, as it used
to be in 1803. The allusions to the garden ground at Dove Cottage, in
the poems which follow, will be noted as they occur.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<td>Bleak season was it, turbulent and bleak,                    <br>
When hitherward we journeyed, side by side,<br>
Through burst of sunshine and through flying showers,<br>
Paced the long vales, how long they were, and yet<br>
How fast that length of way was left behind,                   <br>
Wensley's rich vale and Sedbergh's naked heights.<br>
The frosty wind, as if to make amends<br>
For its keen breath, was aiding to our steps,<br>
And drove us onward like two ships at sea;<br>
Or, like two birds, companions in mid-air,                    <br>
Parted and reunited by the blast.<br>
Stern was the face of nature; we rejoiced<br>
In that stern countenance; for our souls thence drew<br>
A feeling of their strength. The naked trees,<br>
The icy brooks, as on we passed, appeared                     <br>
To question us, "Whence come ye? To what end?"<br>

<a name="27n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">This poem refers to a winter journey on foot, which Wordsworth and his
sister took from Sockburn to Grasmere, by Wensleydale and Askrigg; and,
since he has left us an account of this journey, in a letter to
Coleridge, written a few days after their arrival at Grasmere&mdash;a letter
in which his characterisation of Nature is almost as happy as it is in
his best poems&mdash;some extracts from it may here be appended.</span>

<blockquote>  "We left Sockburn last Tuesday morning. We crossed the Tees by
  moonlight in the Sockburn fields, and after ten good miles riding came
  in sight of the Swale. It is there a beautiful river, with its green
  banks and flat holms scattered over with trees. Four miles further
  brought us to Richmond, with its huge ivied castle, its friarage
  steeple, its castle tower resembling a huge steeple.... We were now in
  Wensleydale, and D. and I set off side by side to foot it as far as
  Kendal.... We reached Askrigg, twelve miles, before six in the
  evening, having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard
  frozen roads.... Next morning the earth was thinly covered with snow,
  enough to make the road soft and prevent its being slippery. On
  leaving Askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall. It was a
  beautiful morning, with driving snow showers, which disappeared by
  fits, and unveiled the east, which was all one delicious pale orange
  colour. After walking through two small fields we came to a mill,
  which we passed, and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before
  us, with an area of grassy ground, and a stream dashing over various
  lamin&aelig; of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs; the bank
  and stream on our left, another woody bank on our right, and the flat
  meadow in front, from which, as at Buttermere, the stream had retired,
  as it were, to hide itself under the shade. As we walked up this
  delightful valley we were tempted to look back perpetually on the
  stream, which reflected the orange lights of the morning among the
  gloomy rocks, with a brightness varying with the agitation of the
  current. The steeple of Askrigg was between us and the east, at the
  bottom of the valley; it was not a quarter of a mile distant.... The
  two banks seemed to join before us with a facing of rock common to
  them both. When we reached this bottom the valley opened out again;
  two rocky banks on each side, which, hung with ivy and moss, and
  fringed luxuriantly with brushwood, ran directly parallel to each
  other, and then approaching with a gentle curve at their point of
  union, presented a lofty waterfall, the termination of the valley. It
  was a keen frosty morning, showers of snow threatening us, but the sun
  bright and active. We had a task of twenty-one miles to perform in a
  short winter's day.... On a nearer approach the waters seemed to fall
  down a tall arch or niche that had shaped itself by insensible
  moulderings in the wall of an old castle. We left this spot with
  reluctance, but highly exhilarated.... It was bitter cold, the wind
  driving the snow behind us in the best style of a mountain storm. We
  soon reached an inn at a place called Hardrane, and descending from
  our vehicles, after warming ourselves by the cottage fire, we walked
  up the brook-side to take a view of a third waterfall. We had not
  walked above a few hundred yards between two winding rocky banks
  before we came full upon the waterfall, which seemed to throw itself
  in a narrow line from a lofty wall of rock, the water, which shot
  manifestly to some distance from the rock, seeming to be dispersed
  into a thin shower scarcely visible before it reached the bason. We
  were disappointed in the cascade itself, though the introductory and
  accompanying banks were an exquisite mixture of grandeur and
  beauty.... After cautiously sounding our way over stones of all
  colours and sizes, encased in the clearest water formed by the spray
  of the fall, we found the rock, which before had appeared like a wall,
  extending itself over our heads, like the ceiling of a huge cave, from
  the summit of which the waters shot directly over our heads into a
  bason, and among fragments wrinkled over with masses of ice as white
  as snow, or rather, as Dorothy says, like congealed froth. The water
  fell at least ten yards from us, and we stood directly behind it, the
  excavation not so deep in the rock as to impress any feeling of
  darkness, but lofty and magnificent; but in connection with the
  adjoining banks excluding as much of the sky as could well be spared
  from a scene so exquisitely beautiful. The spot where we stood was as
  dry as the chamber in which I am now sitting, and the incumbent rock,
  of which the groundwork was limestone, veined and dappled with colours
  which melted into each other with every possible variety of colour. On
  the summit of the cave were three festoons, or rather wrinkles, in the
  rock, run up parallel like the folds of a curtain when it is drawn up.
  Each of these was hung with icicles of various length, and nearly in
  the middle of the festoon, in the deepest valley of the waves that ran
  parallel to each other, the stream shot from the rows of icicles in
  irregular fits of strength, and with a body of water that varied every
  moment. Sometimes the stream shot into the bason in one continued
  current; sometimes it was interrupted almost in the midst of its fall,
  and was blown towards part of the waterfall at no great distance from
  our feet like the heaviest thunder shower. In such a situation you
  have at every moment a feeling of the presence of the sky. Large
  fleecy clouds drove over our heads above the rush of the water, and
  the sky appeared of a blue more than usually brilliant. The rocks on
  each side, which, joining with the side of this cave, formed the vista
  of the brook, were chequered with three diminutive waterfalls, or
  rather courses of water. Each of these was a miniature of all that
  summer and winter can produce of delicate beauty. The rock in the
  centre of the falls, where the water was most abundant, a deep black,
  the adjoining parts yellow, white, purple, and dove colour, covered
  with water&mdash;plants of the most vivid green, and hung with streaming
  icicles, that in some places seem to conceal the verdure of the plants
  and the violet and yellow variegation of the rocks; and in some places
  render the colours more brilliant. I cannot express to you the
  enchanting effect produced by this Arabian scene of colour as the wind
  blew aside the great waterfall behind which we stood, and alternately
  hid and revealed each of these fairy cataracts in irregular
  succession, or displayed them with various gradations of distinctness
  as the intervening spray was thickened or dispersed. What a scene too
  in summer! In the luxury of our imagination we could not help feeding
  upon the pleasure which this cave, in the heat of a July noon, would
  spread through a frame exquisitely sensible. That huge rock on the
  right, the bank winding round on the left with all its living foliage,
  and the breeze stealing up the valley, and bedewing the cavern with
  the freshest imaginable spray. And then the murmur of the water, the
  quiet, the seclusion, and a long summer day."</blockquote>

<td>Fair Ellen Irwin, when she sate                         <br>
Upon the braes of Kirtle,<br>
Was lovely as a Grecian maid<br>
Adorned with wreaths of myrtle;<br>
Young Adam Bruce beside her lay,                      <br>
And there did they beguile the day<br>
With love and gentle speeches,<br>
Beneath the budding beeches.<br><br>

From many knights and many squires<br>
The Bruce had been selected;                         <br>
And Gordon, fairest of them all,<br>
By Ellen was rejected.<br>
Sad tidings to that noble Youth!<br>
For it may be proclaimed with truth,<br>
If Bruce hath loved sincerely,                       <br>
That Gordon loves as dearly.<br><br>

But what are Gordon's form and face,<br>
His shattered hopes and crosses,<br>
To them, 'mid Kirtle's pleasant braes,<br>
Reclined on flowers and mosses?                  <br>
Alas that ever he was born!<br>
The Gordon, couched behind a thorn,<br>
Sees them and their caressing;<br>
Beholds them blest and blessing.<br><br>

Proud Gordon, maddened by the thoughts           <br>
That through his brain are travelling,<br>
Rushed forth, and at the heart of Bruce<br>
He launched a deadly javelin!<br>
Fair Ellen saw it as it came,<br>
And, starting up to meet the same,               <br>
Did with her body cover<br>
The Youth, her chosen lover.<br><br>

And, falling into Bruce's arms,<br>
Thus died the beauteous Ellen,<br>
Thus, from the heart of her True-love,               <br>
The mortal spear repelling.<br>
And Bruce, as soon as he had slain<br>
The Gordon, sailed away to Spain;<br>
And fought with rage incessant<br>
Against the Moorish crescent.<br><br>

But many days, and many months,<br>
And many years ensuing,<br>
This wretched Knight did vainly seek<br>
The death that he was wooing.<br>
So, coming his last help to crave,                   <br>
Heart-broken, upon Ellen's grave<br>
His body he extended,<br>
And there his sorrow ended.<br><br>

Now ye, who willingly have heard<br>
The tale I have been telling,                        <br>
May in Kirkonnel churchyard view<br>
The grave of lovely Ellen:<br>
By Ellen's side the Bruce is laid;<br>
And, for the stone upon his head,<br>
May no rude hand deface it,                          <br>
And its forlorn Hic jacet.<br>

<a name="28n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">No Scottish ballad is superior in pathos to <i>Helen of Kirkconnell</i>.
It is based on a traditionary tale&mdash;the date of the event being
lost&mdash;but the locality, in the parish of Kirkpatrick-Fleming in
Dumfriesshire, is known; and there the graves of "Burd Helen" and her
lover are still pointed out.<br>
<br>
The following is Sir Walter Scott's account of the story:</span>

<blockquote>  "A lady of the name of Helen Irving, or Bell (for this is disputed by
  the two clans), daughter of the laird of Kirkconnell in Dumfriesshire,
  and celebrated for her beauty, was beloved by two gentlemen in the
  neighbourhood. The name of the favoured suitor was Adam Fleming of
  Kirkpatrick: that of the other has escaped tradition, although it has
  been alleged he was a Bell of Blackel-house. The addresses of the
  latter were, however, favoured by the friends of the lady, and the
  lovers were therefore obliged to meet in secret, and by night, in the
  Churchyard of Kirkconnell, a romantic spot, surrounded by the river
  Kirtle. During one of their private interviews, the jealous and
  despised lover suddenly appeared on the opposite bank of the stream,
  and levelled his carbine at the breast of his rival. Helen threw
  herself before her lover, received in her bosom the bullet, and died
  in his arms. A desperate and mortal combat ensued between Fleming and
  the murderer, in which the latter was cut to pieces."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">See <i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i>, vol. ii. p. 317.<br>
<br>
The original ballad&mdash;well known though it is&mdash;may be quoted as an
admirable illustration of the different types of poetic genius in
dealing with the same, or a kindred, theme.</span>

<blockquote>I wish I were where Helen lies!<br>
Night and day on me she cries;<br>
O that I were where Helen lies,<br>
  On fair Kirkconnell lee!<br><br>

Cursed be the heart that thought the thought,<br>
And curst the hand that fired the shot,<br>
When in my arms burd Helen dropt,<br>
  And died to succour me!<br><br>

Oh think ye na my heart was sair,<br>
When my love dropt down and spake nae mair!<br>
There did she swoon wi' meikle care,<br>
  On fair Kirkconnell lee.<br><br>

As I went down the water side,<br>
None but my foe to be my guide,<br>
None but my foe to be my guide,<br>
  On fair Kirkconnell lee&mdash;<br><br>

I lighted down, my sword did draw,<br>
I hacked him in pieces sma',<br>
I hacked him in pieces sma',<br>
  For her sake that died for me.<br><br>

Oh, Helen fair, beyond compare!<br>
I'll weave a garland of thy hair<br>
Shall bind my heart for evermair,<br>
  Until the day I dee!<br><br>

Oh that I were where Helen lies!<br>
Day and night on me she cries;<br>
Out of my bed she bids me rise,<br>
  Says, "Haste, and come to me!"<br><br>

O Helen fair! O Helen chaste!<br>
Were I with thee I would be blest,<br>
Where thou lies low and takes thy rest,<br>
  On fair Kirkconnell lee.<br><br>

I wish my grave were growing green,<br>
A winding sheet drawn o'er my e'en,<br>
And I in Helen's arms lying<br>
  On fair Kirkconnell lee.<br><br>

I wish I were where Helen lies!<br>
Night and day on me she cries,<br>
And I am weary of the skies,<br>
  For her sake that died for me!</blockquote>

<h2><a name="section29"></a>Hart-Leap Well</h2>

<h4>Composed 1800.&mdash;Published 1800</h4>

<a href="#section29a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
Hart-Leap Well is a small spring of water, about five miles from
Richmond in Yorkshire, and near the side of the road which leads from
Richmond to Askrigg. Its name is derived from a remarkable chace, the
memory of which is preserved by the monuments spoken of in the second
Part of the following Poem, which monuments do now exist as I have there
described them.&mdash;W. W. 1800.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[Written at Town-end, Grasmere. The first eight stanzas were composed
extempore one winter evening in the cottage, when, after having tired
myself with labouring at an awkward passage in <i>The Brothers</i>, I
started with a sudden impulse to this to get rid of the other, and
finished it in a day or two. My sister and I had passed the place a few
weeks before in our wild winter journey from Sockburn on the banks of
the Tees to Grasmere. A peasant whom we met near the spot told us the
story so far as concerned the name of the Well, and the Hart, and
pointed out the Stones. Both the stones and the well are objects that
may easily be missed. The tradition by this time may be extinct in the
neighbourhood. The man who related it to us was very old.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>

<td>The Knight had ridden down from Wensley Moor<br>
With the slow motion of a summer's cloud<br>
And now, as he approached a vassal's door,<br>
"Bring forth another horse!" he cried aloud.<br><br>

"Another horse!"&mdash;That shout the vassal heard                   <br>
And saddled his best Steed, a comely grey;<br>
Sir Walter mounted him; he was the third<br>
Which he had mounted on that glorious day.<br><br>

Joy sparkled in the prancing courser's eyes;<br>
The horse and horseman are a happy pair;                       <br>
But, though Sir Walter like a falcon flies,<br>
There is a doleful silence in the air.<br><br>

A rout this morning left Sir Walter's Hall,<br>
That as they galloped made the echoes roar;<br>
But horse and man are vanished, one and all;                   <br>
Such race, I think, was never seen before.<br><br>

Sir Walter, restless as a veering wind,<br>
Calls to the few tired dogs that yet remain:<br>
Blanch, Swift, and Music, noblest of their kind,<br>
Follow, and up the weary mountain strain.<br><br>

The Knight hallooed, he cheered and chid them on<br>
With suppliant gestures and upbraidings stern;<br>
But breath and eyesight fail; and, one by one,<br>
The dogs are stretched among the mountain fern.<br><br>

Where is the throng, the tumult of the race?<br>
The bugles that so joyfully were blown?<br>
&mdash;This chase it looks not like an earthly chase;<br>
Sir Walter and the Hart are left alone.<br><br>

The poor Hart toils along the mountain-side;<br>
I will not stop to tell how far he fled,                       <br>
Nor will I mention by what death he died;<br>
But now the Knight beholds him lying dead.<br><br>

Dismounting, then, he leaned against a thorn;<br>
He had no follower, dog, nor man, nor boy:<br>
He neither cracked his whip, nor blew his horn,            <br>
But gazed upon the spoil with silent joy.<br><br>

Close to the thorn on which Sir Walter leaned,<br>
Stood his dumb partner in this glorious feat;<br>
Weak as a lamb the hour that it is yeaned;<br>
And white with foam as if with cleaving sleet.<br><br>

Upon his side the Hart was lying stretched:<br>
His nostril touched a spring beneath a hill,<br>
And with the last deep groan his breath had fetched<br>
The waters of the spring were trembling still.<br><br>

And now, too happy for repose or rest,                         <br>
(Never had living man such joyful lot!)<br>
Sir Walter walked all round, north, south, and west,<br>
And gazed and gazed upon that darling spot.<br><br>

And climbing up the hill&mdash;(it was at least<br>
Four roods of sheer ascent) Sir Walter found              <br>
Three several hoof-marks which the hunted Beast<br>
Had left imprinted on the grassy ground.<br><br>

Sir Walter wiped his face, and cried, "Till now<br>
Such sight was never seen by human eyes:<br>
Three leaps have borne him from this lofty brow,               <br>
Down to the very fountain where he lies.<br><br>

"I'll build a pleasure-house upon this spot,<br>
And a small arbour, made for rural joy;<br>
'Twill be the traveller's shed, the pilgrim's cot,<br>
A place of love for damsels that are coy.<br><br>

"A cunning artist will I have to frame<br>
A basin for that fountain in the dell!<br>
And they who do make mention of the same,<br>
From this day forth, shall call it <b>Hart-Leap Well</b>.<br><br>

"And, gallant Stag! to make thy praises known,<br>
Another monument shall here be raised;<br>
Three several pillars, each a rough-hewn stone,<br>
And planted where thy hoofs the turf have grazed.<br><br>

"And, in the summer-time when days are long,<br>
I will come hither with my Paramour;                           <br>
And with the dancers and the minstrel's song<br>
We will make merry in that pleasant bower.<br><br>

"Till the foundations of the mountains fail<br>
My mansion with its arbour shall endure;&mdash;<br>
The joy of them who till the fields of Swale,                  <br>
And them who dwell among the woods of Ure!"<br><br>

Then home he went, and left the Hart, stone-dead,<br>
With breathless nostrils stretched above the spring.<br>
&mdash;Soon did the Knight perform what he had said;<br>
And far and wide the fame thereof did ring.<br><br>

Ere thrice the Moon into her port had steered,<br>
A cup of stone received the living well;<br>
Three pillars of rude stone Sir Walter reared,<br>
And built a house of pleasure in the dell.<br><br>

And near the fountain, flowers of stature tall                 <br>
With trailing plants and trees were intertwined,&mdash;<br>
Which soon composed a little sylvan hall,<br>
A leafy shelter from the sun and wind.<br><br>

And thither, when the summer days were long<br>
Sir Walter led his wondering Paramour;                    <br>
And with the dancers and the minstrel's song<br>
Made merriment within that pleasant bower.<br><br>

The Knight, Sir Walter, died in course of time,<br>
And his bones lie in his paternal vale.&mdash;<br>
But there is matter for a second rhyme,                        <br>
And I to this would add another tale.

<td>The moving accident is not my trade;<br>
To freeze the blood I have no ready arts:<br>
'Tis my delight, alone in summer shade,<br>
To pipe a simple song for thinking hearts.<br><br>

As I from Hawes to Richmond did repair,<br>
It chanced that I saw standing in a dell<br>
Three aspens at three corners of a square;<br>
And one, not four yards distant, near a well.<br><br>

What this imported I could ill divine:                          <br>
And, pulling now the rein my horse to stop,<br>
I saw three pillars standing in a line,&mdash;<br>
The last stone-pillar on a dark hill-top.<br><br>

The trees were grey, with neither arms nor head:<br>
Half wasted the square mound of tawny green;                    <br>
So that you just might say, as then I said,<br>
"Here in old time the hand of man hath been."<br><br>

I looked upon the hill both far and near,<br>
More doleful place did never eye survey;<br>
It seemed as if the spring-time came not here,                  <br>
And Nature here were willing to decay.<br><br>

I stood in various thoughts and fancies lost,<br>
When one, who was in shepherd's garb attired,<br>
Came up the hollow:&mdash;him did I accost,<br>
And what this place might be I then inquired. <br><br>

The Shepherd stopped, and that same story told<br>
Which in my former rhyme I have rehearsed.<br>
"A jolly place," said he, "in times of old!<br>
But something ails it now: the spot is curst.<br><br>

"You see these lifeless stumps of aspen wood&mdash;                  <br>
Some say that they are beeches, others elms&mdash;<br>
These were the bower; and here a mansion stood,<br>
The finest palace of a hundred realms!<br><br>

"The arbour does its own condition tell;<br>
You see the stones, the fountain, and the stream;               <br>
But as to the great Lodge! you might as well<br>
Hunt half a day for a forgotten dream.<br><br>

"There's neither dog nor heifer, horse nor sheep,<br>
Will wet his lips within that cup of stone;<br>
And oftentimes, when all are fast asleep,                       <br>
This water doth send forth a dolorous groan.<br><br>

"Some say that here a murder has been done,<br>
And blood cries out for blood: but, for my part,<br>
I've guessed, when I've been sitting in the sun,<br>
That it was all for that unhappy Hart.<br><br>

"What thoughts must through the creature's brain have past!<br>
Even from the topmost stone, upon the steep,<br>
Are but three bounds&mdash;and look, Sir, at this last&mdash;<br>
O Master! it has been a cruel leap.<br><br>

"For thirteen hours he ran a desperate race;                    <br>
And in my simple mind we cannot tell<br>
What cause the Hart might have to love this place,<br>
And come and make his death-bed near the well.<br><br>

"Here on the grass perhaps asleep he sank,<br>
Lulled by the fountain in the summer tide;                 <br>
This water was perhaps the first he drank<br>
When he had wandered from his mother's side.<br><br>

"In April here beneath the flowering thorn<br>
He heard the birds their morning carols sing;<br>
And he, perhaps, for aught we know, was born                    <br>
Not half a furlong from that self-same spring.<br><br>

"Now, here is neither grass nor pleasant shade;<br>
The sun on drearier hollow never shone;<br>
So will it be, as I have often said,<br>
Till trees, and stones, and fountain, all are gone."<br><br>

"Grey-headed Shepherd, thou hast spoken well;<br>
Small difference lies between thy creed and mine:<br>
This Beast not unobserved by Nature fell;<br>
His death was mourned by sympathy divine.<br><br>

"The Being, that is in the clouds and air,                      <br>
That is in the green leaves among the groves,<br>
Maintains a deep and reverential care<br>
For the unoffending creatures whom he loves.<br><br>

"The pleasure-house is dust:&mdash;behind, before,<br>
This is no common waste, no common gloom;                       <br>
But Nature, in due course of time, once more<br>
Shall here put on her beauty and her bloom.<br><br>

"She leaves these objects to a slow decay,<br>
That what we are, and have been, may be known;<br>
But at the coming of the milder day,                            <br>
These monuments shall all be overgrown.<br><br>

"One lesson, Shepherd, let us two divide,<br>
Taught both by what she shows, and what conceals;<br>
Never to blend our pleasure or our pride<br>
With sorrow of the meanest thing that feels."<br>

<a name="29n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">This poem was suggested to Wordsworth in December 1799 during the
journey with his sister from Sockburn in Yorkshire to Grasmere. I owe
the following local note on <i>Hart-Leap Well</i> to Mr. John R. Tutin
of Hull. </span>

  <blockquote>"June 20, 1881. Visited 'Hart-Leap Well,' the subject of Wordsworth's
  poem. It is situated on the road side leading from Richmond to
  Askrigg, at a distance of not more than three and a-half miles from
  Richmond, and not five miles as stated in the prefatory note to the
  poem. The 'three aspens at three corners of a square' are things of
  the past; also the 'three stone pillars standing in a line, on the
  hill above. In a straight line with the spring of water, and where the
  pillars would have been, a wall has been built; so that it is very
  probable the stone pillars were removed at the time of the building of
  this wall. The scenery around answers exactly to the description

    <blockquote>More doleful place did never eye survey;<br>
    It seemed as if the spring time came not here,<br>
    And Nature here were willing to decay.<br>
    ...<br>
    Now, here is neither grass nor pleasant shade.</blockquote>

  "It is barren moor for miles around. The water still falls into the
  'cup of stone,' which appeared to be of very long standing. Within ten
  yards of the well is a small tree, at the same side of the road as the
  well, on the right hand coming from Richmond."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The Rev. Thomas Hutchinson of Kimbolton wrote to me on June 18, 1883:</span>

<blockquote>  "The tree is not a Thorn, but a Lime. It is evidently an old one, but
  is now in full and beautiful leaf. It stands on the western side of
  the road, and a few yards distant from it. The well is somewhat nearer
  the road. This side of the road is open to the fell. On the other side
  the road is bounded by a stone wall: another wall meeting this one at
  right angles, exactly opposite the well. I ascended the hill on the
  north side of this wall for some distance, but could find no trace of
  any rough-hewn stone. Descending on the other side, I found in the
  wall one, and only one, such stone. I should say the base was in the
  wall. The stone itself leans outwards; so that, at the top, three of
  its square faces can be seen; and two, if not three, of these faces
  bear marks of being hammer-dressed. The distance from the stone to the
  well is about 40 yards, and the height of the stone out of the ground
  about 3 or 4 feet.<br>
<br>
  "The ascent from the well is a gentle one, not 'sheer'; nor does there
  appear to be any hollow by which the shepherd could ascend. On the
  western side of the road there is a wide plain, with a slight fall in
  that direction."<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left">
<br>

<h4>A Pastoral</h4>

<h4>Composed 1800.&mdash;Published 1800</h4>

<a href="#section30a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[Written at Town-end, Grasmere. I will only add a little monitory
anecdote concerning this subject. When Coleridge and Southey were
walking together upon the Fells, Southey observed that, if I wished to
be considered a faithful painter of rural manners, I ought not to have
said that my shepherd-boys trimmed their rustic hats as described in the
poem. Just as the words had passed his lips two boys appeared with the
very plant entwined round their hats. I have often wondered that
Southey, who rambled so much about the mountains, should have fallen
into this mistake, and I record it as a warning for others who, with far
less opportunity than my dear friend had of knowing what things are, and
far less sagacity, give way to presumptuous criticism, from which he was
free, though in this matter mistaken. In describing a tarn under
Helvellyn I say:</span>

<blockquote>"There sometimes doth a leaping fish<br>
  Send through the tarn a lonely cheer."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #663300;">This was branded by a critic of these days, in a review ascribed to Mrs.
Barbauld, as unnatural and absurd. I admire the genius of Mrs. Barbauld
and am certain that, had her education been favourable to imaginative
influences, no female of her day would have been more likely to
sympathise with that image, and to acknowledge the truth of the
sentiment.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>

<td>The valley rings with mirth and joy;                    <br>
Among the hills the echoes play<br>
A never never ending song,<br>
To welcome in the May.<br>
The magpie chatters with delight;                       <br>
The mountain raven's youngling brood<br>
Have left the mother and the nest;<br>
And they go rambling east and west<br>
In search of their own food;<br>
Or through the glittering vapours dart                 <br>
In very wantonness of heart.<br><br>

Beneath a rock, upon the grass,<br>
Two boys are sitting in the sun;<br>
Their work, if any work they have,<br>
Is out of mind&mdash;or done.<br>
On pipes of sycamore they play<br>
The fragments of a Christmas hymn;<br>
Or with that plant which in our dale<br>
We call stag-horn, or fox's tail,<br>
Their rusty hats they trim:                            <br>
And thus, as happy as the day,<br>
Those Shepherds wear the time away.<br><br>

Along the river's stony marge<br>
The sand-lark chants a joyous song;<br>
The thrush is busy in the wood,                        <br>
And carols loud and strong.<br>
A thousand lambs are on the rocks,<br>
All newly born! both earth and sky<br>
Keep jubilee, and more than all,<br>
Those boys with their green coronal;                   <br>
They never hear the cry,<br>
That plaintive cry! which up the hill<br>
Comes from the depth of Dungeon-Ghyll.<br><br>

Said Walter, leaping from the ground,<br>
"Down to the stump of yon old yew                      <br>
We'll for our whistles run a race."<br>
&mdash;Away the shepherds flew;<br>
They leapt&mdash;they ran&mdash;and when they came<br>
Right opposite to Dungeon-Ghyll,<br>
Seeing that he should lose the prize,                  <br>
"Stop!" to his comrade Walter cries&mdash;<br>
James stopped with no good will:<br>
Said Walter then, exulting; "Here<br>
You'll find a task for half a year.<br><br>

"Cross, if you dare, where I shall cross&mdash;             <br>
Come on, and tread where I shall tread."<br>
The other took him at his word,<br>
And followed as he led.<br>
It was a spot which you may see<br>
If ever you to Langdale go;                            <br>
Into a chasm a mighty block<br>
Hath fallen, and made a bridge of rock:<br>
The gulf is deep below;<br>
And, in a basin black and small,<br>
Receives a lofty waterfall.<br><br>

With staff in hand across the cleft<br>
The challenger pursued his march;<br>
And now, all eyes and feet, hath gained<br>
The middle of the arch.<br>
When list! he hears a piteous moan&mdash;                   <br>
Again!&mdash;his heart within him dies&mdash;<br>
His pulse is stopped, his breath is lost,<br>
He totters, pallid as a ghost,<br>
And, looking down, espies<br>
A lamb, that in the pool is pent                       <br>
Within that black and frightful rent.<br><br>

The lamb had slipped into the stream,<br>
And safe without a bruise or wound<br>
The cataract had borne him down<br>
Into the gulf profound.<br>
His dam had seen him when he fell,<br>
She saw him down the torrent borne;<br>
And, while with all a mother's love<br>
She from the lofty rocks above<br>
Sent forth a cry forlorn,                              <br>
The lamb, still swimming round and round,<br>
Made answer to that plaintive sound.<br><br>

When he had learnt what thing it was,<br>
That sent this rueful cry; I ween<br>
The Boy recovered heart, and told                      <br>
The sight which he had seen.<br>
Both gladly now deferred their task;<br>
Nor was there wanting other aid&mdash;<br>
A Poet, one who loves the brooks<br>
Far better than the sages' books,                      <br>
By chance had thither strayed;<br>
And there the helpless lamb he found<br>
By those huge rocks encompassed round.<br><br>

He drew it from the troubled pool,<br>
And brought it forth into the light:                   <br>
The Shepherds met him with his charge,<br>
An unexpected sight!<br>
Into their arms the lamb they took,<br>
Whose life and limbs the flood had spared;<br>
Then up the steep ascent they hied,                    <br>
And placed him at his mother's side;<br>
And gently did the Bard<br>
Those idle Shepherd-boys upbraid,<br>
And bade them better mind their trade.<br>

<h2><a name="section31"></a>The Pet-Lamb</h2>

<h4>A Pastoral</h4>

<h4>Composed 1800.&mdash;Published 1800</h4>

<a href="#section31a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[Written at Town-end, Grasmere. Barbara Lewthwaite, now living at
Ambleside (1843), though much changed as to beauty, was one of two most
lovely sisters. Almost the first words my poor brother John said, when
he visited us for the first time at Grasmere, were, "Were those two
Angels that I have just seen?" and from his description, I have no doubt
they were those two sisters. The mother died in childbed; and one of our
neighbours at Grasmere told me that the loveliest sight she had ever
seen was that mother as she lay in her coffin with her babe in her arm.
I mention this to notice what I cannot but think a salutary custom once
universal in these vales. Every attendant on a funeral made it a duty to
look at the corpse in the coffin before the lid was closed, which was
never done (nor I believe is now) till a minute or two before the corpse
was removed. Barbara Lewthwaite was not in fact the child whom I had
seen and overheard as described in the poem. I chose the name for
reasons implied in the above; and here will add a caution against the
use of names of living persons. Within a few months after the
publication of this poem, I was much surprised, and more hurt, to find
it in a child's school book, which, having been compiled by Lindley
Murray, had come into use at Grasmere School where Barbara was a pupil;
and, alas! I had the mortification of hearing that she was very vain of
being thus distinguished; and, in after life she used to say that she
remembered the incident, and what I said to her upon the occasion.&mdash;I.

<td>The dew was falling fast, the stars began to blink;<br>
I heard a voice; it said, "Drink, pretty creature, drink!"<br>
And, looking o'er the hedge, before me I espied<br>
A snow-white mountain-lamb with a Maiden at its side.<br><br>

Nor sheep nor kine were near; the lamb was all alone,<br>
And by a slender cord was tethered to a stone;<br>
With one knee on the grass did the little Maiden kneel,<br>
While to that mountain-lamb she gave its evening meal.<br><br>

The lamb, while from her hand he thus his supper took,<br>
Seemed to feast with head and ears; and his tail with pleasure shook.<br>
"Drink, pretty creature, drink," she said in such a tone<br>
That I almost received her heart into my own.<br><br>

'Twas little Barbara Lewthwaite, a child of beauty rare!<br>
I watched them with delight, they were a lovely pair.<br>
Now with her empty can the Maiden turned away:<br>
But ere ten yards were gone her footsteps did she stay.<br><br>

Right towards the lamb she looked; and from a shady place<br>
I unobserved could see the workings of her face:<br>
If Nature to her tongue could measured numbers bring,<br>
Thus, thought I, to her lamb that little Maid might sing:<br><br>

"What ails thee, young One? what? Why pull so at thy cord?<br>
Is it not well with thee? well both for bed and board?<br>
Thy plot of grass is soft, and green as grass can be;<br>
Rest, little young One, rest; what is't that aileth thee?<br><br>

"What is it thou wouldst seek? What is wanting to thy heart?<br>
Thy limbs are they not strong? And beautiful thou art:<br>
This grass is tender grass; these flowers they have no peers;<br>
And that green corn all day is rustling in thy ears!<br><br>

"If the sun be shining hot, do but stretch thy woollen chain,<br>
This beech is standing by, its covert thou canst gain;<br>
For rain and mountain-storms! the like thou need'st not fear,<br>
The rain and storm are things that scarcely can come here.<br><br>

"Rest, little young One, rest; thou hast forgot the day<br>
When my father found thee first in places far away;<br>
Many flocks were on the hills, but thou wert owned by none,<br>
And thy mother from thy side for evermore was gone.<br><br>

"He took thee in his arms, and in pity brought thee home:<br>
A blessed day for thee! then whither wouldst thou roam?<br>
A faithful nurse thou hast; the dam that did thee yean<br>
Upon the mountain tops no kinder could have been.<br><br>

"Thou know'st that twice a day I have brought thee in this can<br>
Fresh water from the brook, as clear as ever ran;<br>
And twice in the day, when the ground is wet with dew<br>
I bring thee draughts of milk, warm milk it is and new.<br><br>

"Thy limbs will shortly be twice as stout as they are now,<br>
Then I'll yoke thee to my cart like a pony in the plough;<br>
My playmate thou shalt be; and when the wind is cold<br>
Our hearth shall be thy bed, our house shall be thy fold.<br><br>

"It will not, will not rest!&mdash;Poor creature, can it be<br>
That 'tis thy mother's heart which is working so in thee?<br>
Things that I know not of belike to thee are dear,<br>
And dreams of things which thou canst neither see nor hear.<br><br>

"Alas, the mountain-tops that look so green and fair!<br>
I've heard of fearful winds and darkness that come there;<br>
The little brooks that seem all pastime and all play,<br>
When they are angry, roar like lions for their prey.<br><br>

"Here thou need'st not dread the raven in the sky;<br>
Night and day thou art safe,&mdash;our cottage is hard by.<br>
Why bleat so after me? Why pull so at thy chain?<br>
Sleep&mdash;and at break of day I will come to thee again!"<br><br>

&mdash;As homeward through the lane I went with lazy feet,<br>
This song to myself did I oftentimes repeat;<br>
And it seemed, as I retraced the ballad line by line,<br>
That but half of it was hers, and one half of it was <i>mine</i>.<br><br>

Again, and once again, did I repeat the song;<br>
"Nay," said I, "more than half to the damsel must belong,<br>
For she looked with such a look, and she spake with such a tone,<br>
That I almost received her heart into my own."<br>

<h2><a name="section32"></a>The Farmer of Tilsbury Vale</h2>

<h4>Composed 1800.&mdash;Published 1815<a href="#32A"><sup>A</sup></a></h4>

<a href="#section32a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[The character of this man was described to me, and the incident upon
which the verses turn was told me, by Mr. Poole of Nether Stowey, with
whom I became acquainted through our common friend, S.T. Coleridge.
During my residence at Alfoxden, I used to see much of him, and had
frequent occasions to admire the course of his daily life, especially
his conduct to his labourers and poor neighbours; their virtues he
carefully encouraged, and weighed their faults in the scales of charity.
If I seem in these verses to have treated the weaknesses of the farmer
and his transgressions too tenderly, it may in part be ascribed to my
having received the story from one so averse to all harsh judgment.
After his death was found in his escritoir, a lock of grey hair
carefully preserved, with a notice that it had been cut from the head of
his faithful shepherd, who had served him for a length of years. I need
scarcely add that he felt for all men as his brothers. He was much
beloved by distinguished persons&mdash;Mr. Coleridge, Mr. Southey, Sir H.
Davy, and many others; and in his own neighbourhood was highly valued as
a magistrate, a man of business, and in every other social relation. The
latter part of the poem perhaps requires some apology, as being too much
of an echo to <i>The Reverie of Poor Susan</i>.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>

<td>'Tis not for the unfeeling, the falsely refined,<br>
The squeamish in taste, and the narrow of mind,<br>
And the small critic wielding his delicate pen,<br>
That I sing of old Adam, the pride of old men.<br><br>

He dwells in the centre of London's wide Town; <br>
His staff is a sceptre&mdash;his grey hairs a crown;<br>
And his bright eyes look brighter, set off by the streak<br>
Of the unfaded rose that still blooms on his cheek. <br><br>

'Mid the dews, in the sunshine of morn,&mdash;'mid the joy<br>
Of the fields, he collected that bloom, when a boy;<br>
That countenance there fashioned, which, spite of a stain<br>
That his life hath received, to the last will remain.<br><br>

A Farmer he was; and his house far and near<br>
Was the boast of the country for excellent cheer:<br>
How oft have I heard in sweet Tilsbury Vale<br>
Of the silver-rimmed horn whence he dealt his mild ale!<br><br>

Yet Adam was far as the farthest from ruin,<br>
His fields seemed to know what their Master was doing;<br>
And turnips, and corn-land, and meadow, and lea,<br>
All caught the infection&mdash;as generous as he.<br><br>

Yet Adam prized little the feast and the bowl,&mdash;<br>
The fields better suited the ease of his soul:<br>
He strayed through the fields like an indolent wight,<br>
The quiet of nature was Adam's delight.<br><br>

For Adam was simple in thought; and the poor,<br>
Familiar with him, made an inn of his door:<br>
He gave them the best that he had; or, to say<br>
What less may mislead you, they took it away.<br>
<br>
Thus thirty smooth years did he thrive on his farm:<br>
The Genius of plenty preserved him from harm: <br>
At length, what to most is a season of sorrow,<br>
His means are run out,&mdash;he must beg, or must borrow.<br><br>

To the neighbours he went,&mdash;all were free with their money;<br>
For his hive had so long been replenished with honey,<br>
That they dreamt not of dearth;&mdash;He continued his rounds,<br>
Knocked here-and knocked there, pounds still adding to pounds.<br><br>

He paid what he could with his ill-gotten pelf,<br>
And something, it might be, reserved for himself:<br>
Then (what is too true) without hinting a word,<br>
Turned his back on the country&mdash;and off like a bird.<br><br>

You lift up your eyes!&mdash;but I guess that you frame<br>
A judgment too harsh of the sin and the shame;<br>
In him it was scarcely a business of art,<br>
For this he did all in the <i>ease</i> of his heart.<br><br>

To London&mdash;a sad emigration I ween&mdash;<br>
With his grey hairs he went from the brook and the green;<br>
And there, with small wealth but his legs and his hands,<br>
As lonely he stood as a crow on the sands.<br><br>

All trades, as need was, did old Adam assume,&mdash;<br>
Served as stable-boy, errand-boy, porter, and groom;<br>
But nature is gracious, necessity kind,<br>
And, in spite of the shame that may lurk in his mind,<br>
<br>
He seems ten birthdays younger, is green and is stout;<br>
Twice as fast as before does his blood run about;<br>
You would say that each hair of his beard was alive,<br>
And his fingers are busy as bees in a hive.<br><br>

For he's not like an Old Man that leisurely goes<br>
About work that he knows, in a track that he knows;<br>
But often his mind is compelled to demur,<br>
And you guess that the more then his body must stir.<br><br>

In the throng of the town like a stranger is he,<br>
Like one whose own country's far over the sea;<br>
And Nature, while through the great city he hies,<br>
Full ten times a day takes his heart by surprise.<br><br>

This gives him the fancy of one that is young,<br>
More of soul in his face than of words on his tongue;<br>
Like a maiden of twenty he trembles and sighs,<br>
And tears of fifteen will come into his eyes.<br><br>

What's a tempest to him, or the dry parching heats?<br>
Yet he watches the clouds that pass over the streets;<br>
With a look of such earnestness often will stand,<br>
You might think he'd twelve reapers at work in the Strand.<br><br>

Where proud Covent-garden, in desolate hours<br>
Of snow and hoar-frost, spreads her fruits and her flowers,<br>
Old Adam will smile at the pains that have made<br>
Poor winter look fine in such strange masquerade.<br>
<br>
'Mid coaches and chariots, a waggon of straw,<br>
Like a magnet, the heart of old Adam can draw;<br>
With a thousand soft pictures his memory will teem,<br>
And his hearing is touched with the sounds of a dream.<br><br>

Up the Haymarket hill he oft whistles his way,<br>
Thrusts his hands in a waggon, and smells at the hay;<br>
He thinks of the fields he so often hath mown,<br>
And is happy as if the rich freight were his own.<br><br>

But chiefly to Smithfield he loves to repair,&mdash;<br>
If you pass by at morning, you'll meet with him there.<br>
The breath of the cows you may see him inhale,<br>
And his heart all the while is in Tilsbury Vale.<br><br>

Now farewell, old Adam! when low thou art laid,<br>
May one blade of grass spring over thy head;<br>
And I hope that thy grave, wheresoever it be,<br>
Will hear the wind sigh through the leaves of a tree.<br>
