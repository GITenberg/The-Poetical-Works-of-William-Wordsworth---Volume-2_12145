  To <b>Robert Southey, Esq., P.L., Etc., Etc.</b><br>
<br>
 <b> My Dear Friend</b>&mdash;The Tale of <i>Peter Bell</i>, which I now introduce
  to your notice, and to that of the Public, has, in its Manuscript
  state, nearly survived its <i>minority</i>:&mdash;for it first saw the
  light in the summer of 1798. During this long interval, pains have
  been taken at different times to make the production less unworthy of
  a favourable reception; or, rather, to fit it for filling
  <i>permanently</i> a station, however humble, in the Literature of our
  Country. This has, indeed, been the aim of all my endeavours in
  Poetry, which, you know, have been sufficiently laborious to prove
  that I deem the Art not lightly to be approached; and that the
  attainment of excellence in it, may laudably be made the principal
  object of intellectual pursuit by any man, who, with reasonable
  consideration of circumstances, has faith in his own impulses.<br>
<br>
  The Poem of <i>Peter Bell</i>, as the Prologue will show, was composed
  under a belief that the Imagination not only does not require for its
  exercise the intervention of supernatural agency, but that, though
  such agency be excluded, the faculty may be called forth as
  imperiously and for kindred results of pleasure, by incidents, within
  the compass of poetic probability, in the humblest departments of
  daily life. Since that Prologue was written, <i>you</i> have exhibited
  most splendid effects of judicious daring, in the opposite and usual
  course. Let this acknowledgment make my peace with the lovers of the
  supernatural; and I am persuaded it will be admitted, that to you, as
  a Master in that province of the art, the following Tale, whether from
  contrast or congruity, is not an unappropriate offering. Accept it,
  then, as a public testimony of affectionate admiration from one with
  whose name yours has been often coupled (to use your own words) for
  evil and for good; and believe me to be, with earnest wishes that life
  and health may be granted you to complete the many important works in
  which you are engaged, and with high respect, Most faithfully yours,<br>
<br>

<span style="color: #663300;">[Written at Alfoxden. Founded upon an anecdote which I read in a
newspaper, of an ass being found hanging his head over a canal in a
wretched posture. Upon examination a dead body was found in the water,
and proved to be the body of its master. The countenance, gait, and
figure of Peter were taken from a wild rover with whom I walked from
Builth, on the river Wye, downwards, nearly as far as the town of Hay.
He told me strange stories. It has always been a pleasure to me through
life, to catch at every opportunity that has occurred in my rambles of
becoming acquainted with this class of people. The number of Peter's
wives was taken from the trespasses, in this way, of a lawless creature,
who lived in the county of Durham, and used to be attended by many
women, sometimes not less than half a dozen, as disorderly as himself,
and a story went in the country that he had been heard to say, while
they were quarrelling, "Why can't ye be quiet, there's none so many of
you?" Benoni, or the child of sorrow, I knew when I was a schoolboy. His
mother had been deserted by a gentleman in the neighbourhood, she
herself being a gentlewoman by birth. The circumstances of her story
were told me by my dear old dame, Ann Tyson, who was her confidante. The
lady died broken-hearted. In the woods of Alfoxden I used to take great
delight in noticing the habits, tricks, and physiognomy of asses; and I
have no doubt that I was thus put upon writing the poem out of liking
for the creature that is often so dreadfully abused. The crescent moon,
which makes such a figure in the prologue, assumed this character one
evening while I was watching its beauty in front of Alfoxden House. I
intended this poem for the volume before spoken of, but it was not
published for more than twenty years afterwards. The worship of the
Methodists, or Ranters, is often heard during the stillness of the
summer evening, in the country, with affecting accompaniments of rural
beauty. In both the psalmody and voice of the preacher there is, not
unfrequently, much solemnity likely to impress the feelings of the
rudest characters under favourable circumstances.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>

<td>There's something in a flying horse,<br>
There's something in a huge balloon;<br>
But through the clouds I'll never float<br>
Until I have a little Boat,<br>
Shaped like the crescent-moon.<br><br>

And now I <i>have</i> a little Boat,<br>
In shape a very crescent-moon:<br>
Fast through the clouds my boat can sail;<br>
But if perchance your faith should fail,<br>
Look up&mdash;and you shall see me soon!<br><br>

The woods, my Friends, are round you roaring,<br>
Rocking and roaring like a sea;<br>
The noise of danger's in your ears,<br>
And ye have all a thousand fears<br>
Both for my little Boat and me!<br><br>

Meanwhile untroubled I admire<br>
The pointed horns of my canoe;<br>
And, did not pity touch my breast,<br>
To see how ye are all distrest,<br>
Till my ribs ached, I'd laugh at you!<br><br>

Away we go, my Boat and I&mdash;<br>
Frail man ne'er sate in such another;<br>
Whether among the winds we strive,<br>
Or deep into the clouds we dive,<br>
Each is contented with the other.<br><br>

Away we go&mdash;and what care we<br>
For treasons, tumults, and for wars?<br>
We are as calm in our delight<br>
As is the crescent-moon so bright<br>
Among the scattered stars.<br><br>

Up goes my Boat among the stars<br>
Through many a breathless field of light,<br>
Through many a long blue field of ether,<br>
Leaving ten thousand stars beneath her:<br>
Up goes my little Boat so bright!<br><br>

The Crab, the Scorpion, and the Bull&mdash;<br>
We pry among them all; have shot<br>
High o'er the red-haired race of Mars,<br>
Covered from top to toe with scars;<br>
Such company I like it not!<br><br>

The towns in Saturn are decayed,<br>
And melancholy Spectres throng them;&mdash;<br>
The Pleiads, that appear to kiss<br>
Each other in the vast abyss,<br>
With joy I sail among them,<br><br>

Swift Mercury resounds with mirth,<br>
Great Jove is full of stately bowers;<br>
But these, and all that they contain,<br>
What are they to that tiny grain,<br>
That little Earth of ours?<br><br>

Then back to Earth, the dear green Earth:&mdash;<br>
Whole ages if I here should roam,<br>
The world for my remarks and me<br>
Would not a whit the better be;<br>
I've left my heart at home.<br><br>

See! there she is, the matchless Earth!<br>
There spreads the famed Pacific Ocean!<br>
Old Andes thrusts yon craggy spear<br>
Through the grey clouds; the Alps are here,<br>
Like waters in commotion!<br><br>

Yon tawny slip is Libya's sands <br>
That silver thread the river Dnieper;<br>
And look, where clothed in brightest green<br>
Is a sweet Isle, of isles the Queen;<br>
Ye fairies, from all evil keep her! <br><br>

And see the town where I was born!<br>
Around those happy fields we span<br>
In boyish gambols;&mdash;I was lost<br>
Where I have been, but on this coast<br>
I feel I am a man. <br><br>

Never did fifty things at once<br>
Appear so lovely, never, never;&mdash;<br>
How tunefully the forests ring!<br>
To hear the earth's soft murmuring<br>
Thus could I hang for ever! <br><br>

"Shame on you!" cried my little Boat,<br>
"Was ever such a homesick Loon,<br>
Within a living Boat to sit,<br>
And make no better use of it;<br>
A Boat twin-sister of the crescent-moon! <br><br>

"Ne'er in the breast of full-grown Poet<br>
Fluttered so faint a heart before;&mdash;<br>
Was it the music of the spheres<br>
That overpowered your mortal ears?<br>
&mdash;Such din shall trouble them no more. <br><br>

"These nether precincts do not lack<br>
Charms of their own;&mdash;then come with me;<br>
I want a comrade, and for you<br>
There's nothing that I would not do;<br>
Nought is there that you shall not see. <br><br>

"Haste! and above Siberian snows<br>
We'll sport amid the boreal morning;<br>
Will mingle with her lustres gliding<br>
Among the stars, the stars now hiding,<br>
And now the stars adorning. <br><br>

"I know the secrets of a land<br>
Where human foot did never stray;<br>
Fair is that land as evening skies,<br>
And cool, though in the depth it lies<br>
Of burning Africa. <br><br>

"Or we'll into the realm of Faery,<br>
Among the lovely shades of things;<br>
The shadowy forms of mountains bare,<br>
And streams, and bowers, and ladies fair,<br>
The shades of palaces and kings! <br><br>

"Or, if you thirst with hardy zeal<br>
Less quiet regions to explore,<br>
Prompt voyage shall to you reveal<br>
How earth and heaven are taught to feel<br>
The might of magic lore!"<br>
 <br>
"My little vagrant Form of light,<br>
My gay and beautiful Canoe,<br>
Well have you played your friendly part;<br>
As kindly take what from my heart<br>
Experience forces&mdash;then adieu! <br><br>

"Temptation lurks among your words;<br>
But, while these pleasures you're pursuing<br>
Without impediment or let,<br>
No wonder if you quite forget<br>
What on the earth is doing.<br><br>

"There was a time when all mankind<br>
Did listen with a faith sincere<br>
To tuneful tongues in mystery versed;<br>
<i>Then</i> Poets fearlessly rehearsed<br>
The wonders of a wild career.<br><br>

"Go&mdash;(but the world's a sleepy world,<br>
And 'tis, I fear, an age too late)<br>
Take with you some ambitious Youth!<br>
For, restless Wanderer! I, in truth,<br>
Am all unfit to be your mate.<br><br>

"Long have I loved what I behold,<br>
The night that calms, the day that cheers;<br>
The common growth of mother-earth<br>
Suffices me&mdash;her tears, her mirth,<br>
Her humblest mirth and tears.<br><br>

"The dragon's wing, the magic ring,<br>
I shall not covet for my dower,<br>
If I along that lowly way<br>
With sympathetic heart may stray,<br>
And with a soul of power.<br><br>

"These given, what more need I desire<br>
To stir, to soothe, or elevate?<br>
What nobler marvels than the mind<br>
May in life's daily prospect find,<br>
May find or there create?<br><br>

"A potent wand doth Sorrow wield;<br>
What spell so strong as guilty Fear!<br>
Repentance is a tender Sprite;<br>
If aught on earth have heavenly might,<br>
'Tis lodged within her silent tear.<br><br>

"But grant my wishes,&mdash;let us now<br>
Descend from this ethereal height;<br>
Then take thy way, adventurous Skiff,<br>
More daring far than Hippogriff,<br>
And be thy own delight!<br><br>

"To the stone-table in my garden,<br>
Loved haunt of many a summer hour,<br>
The Squire is come: his daughter Bess<br>
Beside him in the cool recess<br>
Sits blooming like a flower.<br><br>

"With these are many more convened;<br>
They know not I have been so far;&mdash;<br>
I see them there, in number nine,<br>
Beneath the spreading Weymouth-pine!<br>
I see them&mdash;there they are!<br><br>

"There sits the Vicar and his Dame;<br>
And there my good friend, Stephen Otter;<br>
And, ere the light of evening fail,<br>
To them I must relate the Tale<br>
Of Peter Bell the Potter."<br><br>

Off flew the Boat&mdash;away she flees,<br>
Spurning her freight with indignation!<br>
"And I, as well as I was able,<br>
On two poor legs, toward my stone-table<br>
Limped on with sore vexation.<br><br>

"O, here he is!" cried little Bess&mdash;<br>
She saw me at the garden-door;<br>
"We've waited anxiously and long,"<br>
They cried, and all around me throng,<br>
Full nine of them or more! <br><br>

"Reproach me not&mdash;your fears be still&mdash;<br>
Be thankful we again have met;&mdash;<br>
Resume, my Friends! within the shade<br>
Your seats, and quickly shall be paid<br>
The well-remembered debt."<br><br>

I spake with faltering voice, like one<br>
Not wholly rescued from the pale<br>
Of a wild dream, or worse illusion;<br>
But, straight, to cover my confusion,<br>
Began the promised Tale.</td>

<td>All by the moonlight river side<br>
Groaned the poor Beast&mdash;alas! in vain;<br>
The staff was raised to loftier height,<br>
And the blows fell with heavier weight<br>
As Peter struck&mdash;and struck again.<br>
<br>
"Hold!" cried the Squire, "against the rules<br>
Of common sense you're surely sinning;<br>
This leap is for us all too bold;<br>
Who Peter was, let that be told,<br>
And start from the beginning."<br><br>

&mdash;"A Potter, Sir, he was by trade,"<br>
Said I, becoming quite collected;<br>
"And wheresoever he appeared,<br>
Full twenty times was Peter feared<br>
For once that Peter was respected.<br><br>

"He two-and-thirty years or more,<br>
Had been a wild and woodland rover;<br>
Had heard the Atlantic surges roar<br>
On farthest Cornwall's rocky shore,<br>
And trod the cliffs of Dover.<br><br>

"And he had seen Caernarvon's towers,<br>
And well he knew the spire of Sarum;<br>
And he had been where Lincoln bell<br>
Flings o'er the fen that ponderous knell&mdash;<br>
A far-renowned alarum.<br><br>

"At Doncaster, at York, and Leeds,<br>
And merry Carlisle had he been;<br>
And all along the Lowlands fair,<br>
All through the bonny shire of Ayr;<br>
And far as Aberdeen.<br><br>

"And he had been at Inverness;<br>
And Peter, by the mountain-rills,<br>
Had danced his round with Highland lasses;<br>
And he had lain beside his asses<br>
On lofty Cheviot Hills:<br><br>

"And he had trudged through Yorkshire dales,<br>
Among the rocks and winding <i>scars</i>;<br>
Where deep and low the hamlets lie<br>
Beneath their little patch of sky<br>
And little lot of stars:<br><br>

"And all along the indented coast,<br>
Bespattered with the salt-sea foam;<br>
Where'er a knot of houses lay<br>
On headland, or in hollow bay;&mdash;<br>
Sure never man like him did roam!<br><br>

"As well might Peter, in the Fleet,<br>
Have been fast bound, a begging debtor;&mdash;<br>
He travelled here, he travelled there;&mdash;<br>
But not the value of a hair<br>
Was heart or head the better.<br><br>

"He roved among the vales and streams,<br>
In the green wood and hollow dell;<br>
They were his dwellings night and day,&mdash;<br>
But nature ne'er could find the way<br>
Into the heart of Peter Bell.<br><br>

"In vain, through every changeful year,<br>
Did Nature lead him as before;<br>
A primrose by a river's brim<br>
A yellow primrose was to him,<br>
And it was nothing more.<br><br>

"Small change it made in Peter's heart<br>
To see his gentle panniered train<br>
With more than vernal pleasure feeding,<br>
Where'er the tender grass was leading<br>
Its earliest green along the lane.<br><br>

"In vain, through water, earth, and air,<br>
The soul of happy sound was spread,<br>
When Peter on some April morn,<br>
Beneath the broom or budding thorn,<br>
Made the warm earth his lazy bed.<br><br>

"At noon, when, by the forest's edge<br>
He lay beneath the branches high,<br>
The soft blue sky did never melt<br>
Into his heart; he never felt<br>
The witchery of the soft blue sky!<br><br>

"On a fair prospect some have looked<br>
And felt, as I have heard them say,<br>
As if the moving time had been<br>
A thing as steadfast as the scene<br>
On which they gazed themselves away.<br><br>

"Within the breast of Peter Bell<br>
These silent raptures found no place;<br>
He was a Carl as wild and rude<br>
As ever hue-and-cry pursued,<br>
As ever ran a felon's race.<br><br>

"Of all that lead a lawless life,<br>
Of all that love their lawless lives,<br>
In city or in village small,<br>
He was the wildest far of all;&mdash;<br>
He had a dozen wedded wives.<br><br>

"Nay, start not!&mdash;wedded wives&mdash;and twelve!<br>
But how one wife could e'er come near him,<br>
In simple truth I cannot tell;<br>
For, be it said of Peter Bell,<br>
To see him was to fear him.<br><br>

"Though Nature could not touch his heart<br>
By lovely forms, and silent weather,<br>
And tender sounds, yet you might see<br>
At once, that Peter Bell and she <br>
Had often been together. <br><br>

"A savage wildness round him hung<br>
As of a dweller out of doors;<br>
In his whole figure and his mien<br>
A savage character was seen<br>
Of mountains and of dreary moors.<br><br>

"To all the unshaped half-human thoughts<br>
Which solitary Nature feeds<br>
'Mid summer storms or winter's ice,<br>
Had Peter joined whatever vice<br>
The cruel city breeds.<br><br>

"His face was keen as is the wind<br>
That cuts along the hawthorn-fence;<br>
Of courage you saw little there,<br>
But, in its stead, a medley air<br>
Of cunning and of impudence.<br><br>

"He had a dark and sidelong walk,<br>
And long and slouching was his gait;<br>
Beneath his looks so bare and bold,<br>
You might perceive, his spirit cold<br>
Was playing with some inward bait.<br><br>

"His forehead wrinkled was and furred;<br>
A work, one half of which was done <br>
By thinking of his '<i>whens</i>,' and '<i>hows</i>';<br>
And half, by knitting of his brows<br>
Beneath the glaring sun.<br><br>

"There was a hardness in his cheek,<br>
There was a hardness in his eye,<br>
As if the man had fixed his face,<br>
In many a solitary place,<br>
Against the wind and open sky!"<br><br>

 &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br><br>

One night, (and now my little Bess!<br>
We've reached at last the promised Tale;)<br>
One beautiful November night,<br>
When the full moon was shining bright<br>
Upon the rapid river Swale,<br><br>

Along the river's winding banks<br>
Peter was travelling all alone;<br>
Whether to buy or sell, or led<br>
By pleasure running in his head,<br>
To me was never known.<br> <br>

He trudged along through copse and brake,<br>
He trudged along o'er hill and dale;<br>
Nor for the moon cared he a tittle,<br>
And for the stars he cared as little,<br>
And for the murmuring river Swale.<br><br>

But, chancing to espy a path<br>
That promised to cut short the way;<br>
As many a wiser man hath done,<br>
He left a trusty guide for one<br>
That might his steps betray.<br><br>

To a thick wood he soon is brought<br>
Where cheerily his course he weaves,<br>
And whistling loud may yet be heard,<br>
Though often buried, like a bird<br>
Darkling, among the boughs and leaves.<br><br>

But quickly Peter's mood is changed,<br>
And on he drives with cheeks that burn<br>
In downright fury and in wrath;&mdash;<br>
There's little sign the treacherous path<br>
Will to the road return!<br><br>

The path grows dim, and dimmer still;<br>
Now up, now down, the Rover wends,<br>
With all the sail that he can carry,<br>
Till brought to a deserted quarry&mdash; <br>
And there the pathway ends.<br>
<br>
He paused&mdash;for shadows of strange shape,<br>
Massy and black, before him lay;<br>
But through the dark, and through the cold,<br>
And through the yawning fissures old,<br>
Did Peter boldly press his way<br><br>

Right through the quarry;&mdash;and behold<br>
A scene of soft and lovely hue!<br>
Where blue and grey, and tender green,<br>
Together make as sweet a scene<br>
As ever human eye did view.<br><br>

Beneath the clear blue sky he saw<br>
A little field of meadow ground;<br>
But field or meadow name it not;<br>
Call it of earth a small green plot,<br>
With rocks encompassed round.<br><br>

The Swale flowed under the grey rocks,<br>
But he flowed quiet and unseen;&mdash;<br>
You need a strong and stormy gale<br>
To bring the noises of the Swale<br>
To that green spot, so calm and green!<br>
<br>
And is there no one dwelling here,<br>
No hermit with his beads and glass?<br>
And does no little cottage look<br>
Upon this soft and fertile nook?<br>
Does no one live near this green grass?<br><br>

Across the deep and quiet spot<br>
Is Peter driving through the grass&mdash;<br>
And now has reached the skirting trees;<br>
When, turning round his head, he sees<br>
A solitary Ass.<br>
<br>
"A prize!" cries Peter&mdash;but he first<br>
Must spy about him far and near:<br>
There's not a single house in sight,<br>
No woodman's hut, no cottage light&mdash;<br>
Peter, you need not fear!<br><br>

There's nothing to be seen but woods,<br>
And rocks that spread a hoary gleam,<br>
And this one Beast, that from the bed<br>
Of the green meadow hangs his head<br>
Over the silent stream.<br><br>

His head is with a halter bound;<br>
The halter seizing, Peter leapt<br>
Upon the Creature's back, and plied<br>
With ready heels his shaggy side;<br>
But still the Ass his station kept.<br>
<br>
Then Peter gave a sudden jerk,<br>
A jerk that from a dungeon-floor<br>
Would have pulled up an iron ring;<br>
But still the heavy-headed Thing<br>
Stood just as he had stood before!<br><br>

Quoth Peter, leaping from his seat,<br>
"There is some plot against me laid";<br>
Once more the little meadow-ground<br>
And all the hoary cliffs around<br>
He cautiously surveyed.<br><br>

All, all is silent&mdash;rocks and woods,<br>
All still and silent&mdash;far and near!<br>
Only the Ass, with motion dull,<br>
Upon the pivot of his skull<br>
Turns round his long left ear.<br><br>

Thought Peter, What can mean all this?<br>
Some ugly witchcraft must be here!<br>
&mdash;Once more the Ass, with motion dull,<br>
Upon the pivot of his skull<br>
Turned round his long left ear.<br><br>

Suspicion ripened into dread;<br>
Yet with deliberate action slow,<br>
His staff high-raising, in the pride<br>
Of skill, upon the sounding hide,<br>
He dealt a sturdy blow.<br><br>

The poor Ass staggered with the shock;<br>
And then, as if to take his ease,<br>
In quiet uncomplaining mood,<br>
Upon the spot where he had stood,<br>
Dropped gently down upon his knees;<br><br>

As gently on his side he fell;<br>
And by the river's brink did lie;<br>
And, while he lay like one that mourned,<br>
The patient Beast on Peter turned<br>
His shining hazel eye.<br><br>

'Twas but one mild, reproachful look,<br>
A look more tender than severe;<br>
And straight in sorrow, not in dread,<br>
He turned the eye-ball in his head<br>
Towards the smooth river deep and clear.<br><br>

Upon the Beast the sapling rings;<br>
His lank sides heaved, his limbs they stirred;<br>
He gave a groan, and then another,<br>
Of that which went before the brother,<br>
And then he gave a third.<br><br>

All by the moonlight river side<br>
He gave three miserable groans;<br>
And not till now hath Peter seen<br>
How gaunt the Creature is,&mdash;how lean<br>
And sharp his staring bones!<br><br>

With legs stretched out and stiff he lay:&mdash;<br>
No word of kind commiseration<br>
Fell at the sight from Peter's tongue;<br>
With hard contempt his heart was wrung,<br>
With hatred and vexation.<br><br>

The meagre beast lay still as death;<br>
And Peter's lips with fury quiver;<br>
Quoth he, "You little mulish dog,<br>
I'll fling your carcass like a log<br>
Head-foremost down the river!"<br><br>

An impious oath confirmed the threat&mdash;<br>
Whereat from the earth on which he lay<br>
To all the echoes, south and north,<br>
And east and west, the Ass sent forth<br>
A long and clamorous bray!<br><br>

This outcry, on the heart of Peter,<br>
Seems like a note of joy to strike,&mdash;<br>
Joy at the heart of Peter knocks;<br>
But in the echo of the rocks<br>
Was something Peter did not like.<br><br>

Whether to cheer his coward breast,<br>
Or that he could not break the chain,<br>
In this serene and solemn hour,<br>
Twined round him by demoniac power,<br>
To the blind work he turned again.<br><br>

Among the rocks and winding crags;<br>
Among the mountains far away;<br>
Once more the Ass did lengthen out<br>
More ruefully a deep-drawn shout,<br>
The hard dry see-saw of his horrible bray!<br><br>

What is there now in Peter's heart!<br>
Or whence the might of this strange sound?<br>
The moon uneasy looked and dimmer,<br>
The broad blue heavens appeared to glimmer,<br>
And the rocks staggered all around&mdash;<br><br>

From Peter's hand the sapling dropped!<br>
Threat has he none to execute;<br>
"If any one should come and see<br>
That I am here, they'll think," quoth he,<br>
"I'm helping this poor dying brute."<br><br>

He scans the Ass from limb to limb,<br>
And ventures now to uplift his eyes;<br>
More steady looks the moon, and clear,<br>
More like themselves the rocks appear<br>
And touch more quiet skies.<br><br>

His scorn returns&mdash;his hate revives;<br>
He stoops the Ass's neck to seize<br>
With malice&mdash;that again takes flight;<br>
For in the pool a startling sight<br>
Meets him, among the inverted trees.<br><br>

Is it the moon's distorted face?<br>
The ghost-like image of a cloud?<br>
Is it a gallows there portrayed?<br>
Is Peter of himself afraid?<br>
Is it a coffin,&mdash;or a shroud?<br><br>

A grisly idol hewn in stone?<br>
Or imp from witch's lap let fall?<br>
Perhaps a ring of shining fairies?<br>
Such as pursue their feared vagaries<br>
In sylvan bower, or haunted hall?<br><br>

Is it a fiend that to a stake<br>
Of fire his desperate self is tethering?<br>
Or stubborn spirit doomed to yell<br>
In solitary ward or cell,<br>
Ten thousand miles from all his brethren?<br>
<br>
Never did pulse so quickly throb,<br>
And never heart so loudly panted;<br>
He looks, he cannot choose but look;<br>
Like some one reading in a book&mdash;<br>
A book that is enchanted.<br><br>

Ah, well-a-day for Peter Bell!<br>
He will be turned to iron soon,<br>
Meet Statue for the court of Fear!<br>
His hat is up&mdash;and every hair<br>
Bristles, and whitens in the moon!<br><br>

He looks, he ponders, looks again;<br>
He sees a motion&mdash;hears a groan;<br>
His eyes will burst&mdash;his heart will break&mdash;<br>
He gives a loud and frightful shriek,<br>
And back he falls, as if his life were flown!</td>

<td>We left our Hero in a trance,<br>
Beneath the alders, near the river;<br>
The Ass is by the river-side,<br>
And, where the feeble breezes glide,<br>
Upon the stream the moonbeams quiver.<br><br>

A happy respite! but at length<br>
He feels the glimmering of the moon;<br>
Wakes with glazed eye, and feebly sighing&mdash;<br>
To sink, perhaps, where he is lying,<br>
Into a second swoon!<br><br>

He lifts his head, he sees his staff;<br>
He touches&mdash;'tis to him a treasure!<br>
Faint recollection seems to tell<br>
That he is yet where mortals dwell&mdash;<br>
A thought received with languid pleasure!<br><br>

His head upon his elbow propped,<br>
Becoming less and less perplexed,<br>
Sky-ward he looks&mdash;to rock and wood&mdash;<br>
And then&mdash;upon the glassy flood<br>
His wandering eye is fixed.<br><br>

Thought he, that is the face of one<br>
In his last sleep securely bound!<br>
So toward the stream his head he bent,<br>
And downward thrust his staff, intent<br>
The river's depth to sound.<br><br>

<i>Now</i>&mdash;like a tempest-shattered bark,<br>
That overwhelmed and prostrate lies,<br>
And in a moment to the verge<br>
Is lifted of a foaming surge&mdash;<br>
Full suddenly the Ass doth rise!<br><br>

His staring bones all shake with joy,<br>
And close by Peter's side he stands:<br>
While Peter o'er the river bends,<br>
The little Ass his neck extends,<br>
And fondly licks his hands.<br><br>

Such life is in the Ass's eyes,<br>
Such life is in his limbs and ears;<br>
That Peter Bell, if he had been<br>
The veriest coward ever seen,<br>
Must now have thrown aside his fears.<br><br>

The Ass looks on&mdash;and to his work<br>
Is Peter quietly resigned;<br>
He touches here&mdash;he touches there&mdash;<br>
And now among the dead man's hair<br>
His sapling Peter has entwined.<br><br>

He pulls&mdash;and looks&mdash;and pulls again;<br>
And he whom the poor Ass had lost,<br>
The man who had been four days dead,<br>
Head-foremost from the river's bed<br>
Uprises like a ghost!<br><br>

And Peter draws him to dry land;<br>
And through the brain of Peter pass<br>
Some poignant twitches, fast and faster;<br>
"No doubt," quoth he, "he is the Master<br>
Of this poor miserable Ass!"<br><br>

The meagre shadow that looks on&mdash;<br>
What would he now? what is he doing?<br>
His sudden fit of joy is flown,&mdash;<br>
He on his knees hath laid him down,<br>
As if he were his grief renewing;<br><br>

But no&mdash;that Peter on his back<br>
Must mount, he shows well as he can:<br>
Thought Peter then, come weal or woe<br>
I'll do what he would have me do,<br>
In pity to this poor drowned man.<br><br>

With that resolve he boldly mounts<br>
Upon the pleased and thankful Ass;<br>
And then, without a moment's stay,<br>
That earnest Creature turned away,<br>
Leaving the body on the grass.<br><br>

Intent upon his faithful watch,<br>
The Beast four days and nights had past;<br>
A sweeter meadow ne'er was seen,<br>
And there the Ass four days had been,<br>
Nor ever once did break his fast:<br><br>

Yet firm his step, and stout his heart;<br>
The mead is crossed&mdash;the quarry's mouth<br>
Is reached; but there the trusty guide<br>
Into a thicket turns aside,<br>
And deftly ambles towards the south.<br><br>

When hark a burst of doleful sound!<br>
And Peter honestly might say,<br>
The like came never to his ears,<br>
Though he has been, full thirty years,<br>
A rover&mdash;night and day!<br><br>

'Tis not a plover of the moors,<br>
'Tis not a bittern of the fen;<br>
Nor can it be a barking fox,<br>
Nor night-bird chambered in the rocks,<br>
Nor wild-cat in a woody glen!<br><br>

The Ass is startled&mdash;and stops short<br>
Right in the middle of the thicket;<br>
And Peter, wont to whistle loud<br>
Whether alone or in a crowd,<br>
Is silent as a silent cricket.<br><br>

What ails you now, my little Bess?<br>
Well may you tremble and look grave!<br>
This cry&mdash;that rings along the wood,<br>
This cry&mdash;that floats adown the flood,<br>
Comes from the entrance of a cave:<br><br>

I see a blooming Wood-boy there,<br>
And if I had the power to say<br>
How sorrowful the wanderer is,<br>
Your heart would be as sad as his<br>
Till you had kissed his tears away!<br><br>

Grasping a hawthorn branch in hand,<br>
All bright with berries ripe and red,<br>
Into the cavern's mouth he peeps;<br>
Thence back into the moonlight creeps;<br>
Whom seeks he&mdash;whom?&mdash;the silent dead:<br><br>

His father!&mdash;Him doth he require&mdash;<br>
Him hath he sought with fruitless pains,<br>
Among the rocks, behind the trees;<br>
Now creeping on his hands and knees,<br>
Now running o'er the open plains.<br><br>

And hither is he come at last,<br>
When he through such a day has gone,<br>
By this dark cave to be distrest<br>
Like a poor bird&mdash;her plundered nest<br>
Hovering around with dolorous moan!<br><br>

Of that intense and piercing cry<br>
The listening Ass conjectures well;<br>
Wild as it is, he there can read<br>
Some intermingled notes that plead<br>
With touches irresistible.<br><br>

But Peter&mdash;when he saw the Ass<br>
Not only stop but turn, and change<br>
The cherished tenor of his pace<br>
That lamentable cry to chase&mdash;<br>
It wrought in him conviction strange;<br><br>

A faith that, for the dead man's sake<br>
And this poor slave who loved him well,<br>
Vengeance upon his head will fall,<br>
Some visitation worse than all<br>
Which ever till this night befel.<br><br>

Meanwhile the Ass to reach his home,<br>
Is striving stoutly as he may;<br>
But, while he climbs the woody hill,<br>
The cry grows weak&mdash;and weaker still;<br>
And now at last it dies away.<br><br>

So with his freight the Creature turns<br>
Into a gloomy grove of beech,<br>
Along the shade with footsteps true<br>
Descending slowly, till the two<br>
The open moonlight reach.<br><br>

And there, along the narrow dell,<br>
A fair smooth pathway you discern,<br>
A length of green and open road&mdash;<br>
As if it from a fountain flowed&mdash;<br>
Winding away between the fern.<br><br>

The rocks that tower on either side<br>
Build up a wild fantastic scene;<br>
Temples like those among the Hindoos,<br>
And mosques, and spires, and abbey-windows,<br>
And castles all with ivy green!<br><br>

And, while the Ass pursues his way,<br>
Along this solitary dell,<br>
As pensively his steps advance,<br>
The mosques and spires change countenance,<br>
And look at Peter Bell!<br><br>

That unintelligible cry<br>
Hath left him high in preparation,&mdash;<br>
Convinced that he, or soon or late,<br>
This very night will meet his fate&mdash;<br>
And so he sits in expectation!<br>
<br>
The strenuous Animal hath clomb<br>
With the green path; and now he wends<br>
Where, shining like the smoothest sea,<br>
In undisturbed immensity<br>
A level plain extends.<br><br>

But whence this faintly-rustling sound<br>
By which the journeying pair are chased?<br>
&mdash;A withered leaf is close behind,<br>
Light plaything for the sportive wind<br>
Upon that solitary waste.<br><br>

When Peter spied the moving thing,<br>
It only doubled his distress;<br>
"Where there is not a bush or tree,<br>
The very leaves they follow me&mdash;<br>
So huge hath been my wickedness!"<br><br>

To a close lane they now are come,<br>
Where, as before, the enduring Ass<br>
Moves on without a moment's stop,<br>
Nor once turns round his head to crop<br>
A bramble-leaf or blade of grass.<br><br>

Between the hedges as they go,<br>
The white dust sleeps upon the lane;<br>
And Peter, ever and anon<br>
Back-looking, sees, upon a stone,<br>
Or in the dust, a crimson stain.<br><br>

A stain&mdash;as of a drop of blood<br>
By moonlight made more faint and wan;<br>
Ha! why these sinkings of despair?<br>
He knows not how the blood comes there&mdash;<br>
And Peter is a wicked man.<br><br>

At length he spies a bleeding wound,<br>
Where he had struck the Ass's head;<br>
He sees the blood, knows what it is,&mdash;<br>
A glimpse of sudden joy was his,<br>
But then it quickly fled;<br><br>

Of him whom sudden death had seized<br>
He thought,&mdash;of thee, O faithful Ass!<br>
And once again those ghastly pains,<br>
Shoot to and fro through heart and reins,<br>
And through his brain like lightning pass.</td>

<td>I've heard of one, a gentle Soul,<br>
Though given to sadness and to gloom, <br>
And for the fact will vouch,&mdash;one night<br>
It chanced that by a taper's light<br>
This man was reading in his room;<br><br>

Bending, as you or I might bend<br>
At night o'er any pious book,<br>
When sudden blackness overspread<br>
The snow-white page on which he read,<br>
And made the good man round him look.<br><br>

The chamber walls were dark all round,&mdash;<br>
And to his book he turned again;<br>
&mdash;The light had left the lonely taper,<br>
And formed itself upon the paper<br>
Into large letters&mdash;bright and plain!<br><br>

The godly book was in his hand&mdash;<br>
And, on the page, more black than coal,<br>
Appeared, set forth in strange array,<br>
A <i>word</i>&mdash;which to his dying day<br>
Perplexed the good man's gentle soul.<br><br>

The ghostly word, thus plainly seen,<br>
Did never from his lips depart;<br>
But he hath said, poor gentle wight!<br>
It brought full many a sin to light<br>
Out of the bottom of his heart.<br><br>

Dread Spirits! to confound the meek<br>
Why wander from your course so far,<br>
Disordering colour, form, and stature!<br>
&mdash;Let good men feel the soul of nature,<br>
And see things as they are.<br><br>

Yet, potent Spirits! well I know,<br>
How ye, that play with soul and sense,<br>
Are not unused to trouble friends<br>
Of goodness, for most gracious ends&mdash;<br>
And this I speak in reverence!<br><br>

But might I give advice to you,<br>
Whom in my fear I love so well;<br>
From men of pensive virtue go,<br>
Dread Beings! and your empire show<br>
On hearts like that of Peter Bell.<br><br>

Your presence often have I felt<br>
In darkness and the stormy night;<br>
And, with like force, if need there be,<br>
Ye can put forth your agency<br>
When earth is calm, and heaven is bright.<br><br>

Then, coming from the wayward world,<br>
That powerful world in which ye dwell,<br>
Come, Spirits of the Mind! and try,<br>
To-night, beneath the moonlight sky,<br>
What may be done with Peter Bell!<br><br>

&mdash;O, would that some more skilful voice<br>
My further labour might prevent!<br>
Kind Listeners, that around me sit,<br>
I feel that I am all unfit<br>
For such high argument.<br><br>

I've played, I've danced, with my narration;<br>
I loitered long ere I began:<br>
Ye waited then on my good pleasure;<br>
Pour out indulgence still, in measure<br>
As liberal as ye can!<br><br>

Our Travellers, ye remember well,<br>
Are thridding a sequestered lane;<br>
And Peter many tricks is trying,<br>
And many anodynes applying,<br>
To ease his conscience of its pain.<br><br>

By this his heart is lighter far;<br>
And, finding that he can account<br>
So snugly for that crimson stain,<br>
His evil spirit up again<br>
Does like an empty bucket mount.<br><br>

And Peter is a deep logician<br>
Who hath no lack of wit mercurial;<br>
"Blood drops&mdash;leaves rustle&mdash;yet," quoth he,<br>
"This poor man never, but for me,<br>
Could have had Christian burial.<br><br>

"And, say the best you can, 'tis plain,<br>
That here has been some wicked dealing;<br>
No doubt the devil in me wrought;<br>
I'm not the man who could have thought<br>
An Ass like this was worth the stealing!"<br><br>

So from his pocket Peter takes<br>
His shining horn tobacco-box;<br>
And, in a light and careless way,<br>
As men who with their purpose play,<br>
Upon the lid he knocks.<br><br>

Let them whose voice can stop the clouds,<br>
Whose cunning eye can see the wind,<br>
Tell to a curious world the cause<br>
Why, making here a sudden pause,<br>
The Ass turned round his head, and <i>grinned.</i><br><br>

Appalling process! I have marked<br>
The like on heath, in lonely wood;<br>
And, verily, have seldom met<br>
A spectacle more hideous&mdash;yet<br>
It suited Peter's present mood.<br><br>

And, grinning in his turn, his teeth<br>
He in jocose defiance showed&mdash;<br>
When, to upset his spiteful mirth,<br>
A murmur, pent within the earth,<br>
In the dead earth beneath the road,<br><br>

Rolled audibly! it swept along,<br>
A muffled noise&mdash;a rumbling sound!&mdash;<br>
'Twas by a troop of miners made,<br>
Plying with gunpowder their trade,<br>
Some twenty fathoms underground.<br><br>

Small cause of dire effect! for, surely,<br>
If ever mortal, King or Cotter,<br>
Believed that earth was charged to quake<br>
And yawn for his unworthy sake,<br>
'Twas Peter Bell the Potter.<br><br>

But, as an oak in breathless air<br>
Will stand though to the centre hewn;<br>
Or as the weakest things, if frost<br>
Have stiffened them, maintain their post;<br>
So he, beneath the gazing moon!&mdash;<br><br>

The Beast bestriding thus, he reached<br>
A spot where, in a sheltering cove,<br>
A little chapel stands alone,<br>
With greenest ivy overgrown,<br>
And tufted with an ivy grove;<br><br>

Dying insensibly away<br>
From human thoughts and purposes,<br>
It seemed&mdash;wall, window, roof and tower&mdash;<br>
To bow to some transforming power,<br>
And blend with the surrounding trees.<br><br>

As ruinous a place it was,<br>
Thought Peter, in the shire of Fife<br>
That served my turn, when following still<br>
From land to land a reckless will<br>
I married my sixth wife!<br><br>

The unheeding Ass moves slowly on,<br>
And now is passing by an inn<br>
Brim-full of a carousing crew,<br>
That make, with curses not a few,<br>
An uproar and a drunken din.<br><br>

I cannot well express the thoughts<br>
Which Peter in those noises found;&mdash;<br>
A stifling power compressed his frame,<br>
While-as a swimming darkness came<br>
Over that dull and dreary sound.<br><br>

For well did Peter know the sound;<br>
The language of those drunken joys<br>
To him, a jovial soul, I ween,<br>
But a few hours ago, had been<br>
A gladsome and a welcome noise.<br><br>

<i>Now</i>, turned adrift into the past,<br>
He finds no solace in his course;<br>
Like planet-stricken men of yore,<br>
He trembles, smitten to the core<br>
By strong compunction and remorse.<br><br>

But, more than all, his heart is stung<br>
To think of one, almost a child;<br>
A sweet and playful Highland girl,<br>
As light and beauteous as a squirrel,<br>
As beauteous and as wild!<br><br>

Her dwelling was a lonely house,<br>
A cottage in a heathy dell;<br>
And she put on her gown of green,<br>
And left her mother at sixteen,<br>
And followed Peter Bell.<br><br>

But many good and pious thoughts<br>
Had she; and, in the kirk to pray,<br>
Two long Scotch miles, through rain or snow,<br>
To kirk she had been used to go,<br>
Twice every Sabbath-day.<br><br>

And, when she followed Peter Bell,<br>
It was to lead an honest life;<br>
For he, with tongue not used to falter,<br>
Had pledged his troth before the altar<br>
To love her as his wedded wife.<br><br>

A mother's hope is hers;&mdash;but soon<br>
She drooped and pined like one forlorn;<br>
From Scripture she a name did borrow;<br>
Benoni, or the child of sorrow,<br>
She called her babe unborn.<br><br>

For she had learned how Peter lived,<br>
And took it in most grievous part;<br>
She to the very bone was worn,<br>
And, ere that little child was born,<br>
Died of a broken heart.<br><br>

And now the Spirits of the Mind<br>
Are busy with poor Peter Bell;<br>
Upon the rights of visual sense<br>
Usurping, with a prevalence<br>
More terrible than magic spell.<br><br>

Close by a brake of flowering furze<br>
(Above it shivering aspens play)<br>
He sees an unsubstantial creature,<br>
His very self in form and feature,<br>
Not four yards from the broad highway:<br><br>

And stretched beneath the furze he sees<br>
The Highland girl&mdash;it is no other;<br>
And hears her crying as she cried,<br>
The very moment that she died,<br>
"My mother! oh my mother!"<br><br>

The sweat pours down from Peter's face,<br>
So grievous is his heart's contrition;<br>
With agony his eye-balls ache<br>
While he beholds by the furze-brake<br>
This miserable vision!<br><br>

Calm is the well-deserving brute,<br>
<i>His</i> peace hath no offence betrayed;<br>
But now, while down that slope he wends,<br>
A voice to Peter's ear ascends,<br>
Resounding from the woody glade:<br><br>

The voice, though clamorous as a horn<br>
Re-echoed by a naked rock,<br>
Comes from that tabernacle&mdash;List!<br>
Within, a fervent Methodist<br>
Is preaching to no heedless flock!<br><br>

"Repent! repent!" he cries aloud,<br>
"While yet ye may find mercy;&mdash;strive<br>
To love the Lord with all your might;<br>
Turn to him, seek him day and night,<br>
And save your souls alive!<br><br>

"Repent! repent! though ye have gone,<br>
Through paths of wickedness and woe,<br>
After the Babylonian harlot;<br>
And, though your sins be red as scarlet,<br>
They shall be white as snow!"<br><br>

Even as he passed the door, these words<br>
Did plainly come to Peter's ears;<br>
And they such joyful tidings were,<br>
The joy was more than he could bear!&mdash;<br>
He melted into tears.<br><br>

Sweet tears of hope and tenderness!<br>
And fast they fell, a plenteous shower!<br>
His nerves, his sinews seemed to melt;<br>
Through all his iron frame was felt<br>
A gentle, a relaxing, power!<br><br>

Each fibre of his frame was weak;<br>
Weak all the animal within;<br>
But, in its helplessness, grew mild<br>
And gentle as an infant child,<br>
An infant that has known no sin.<br><br>

'Tis said, meek Beast! that, through Heaven's grace,<br>
He not unmoved did notice now<br>
The cross upon thy shoulder scored,<br>
For lasting impress, by the Lord<br>
To whom all human-kind shall bow;<br><br>

Memorial of his touch&mdash;that day<br>
When Jesus humbly deigned to ride,<br>
Entering the proud Jerusalem,<br>
By an immeasurable stream<br>
Of shouting people deified!<br><br>

Meanwhile the persevering Ass,<br>
Turned towards a gate that hung in view<br>
Across a shady lane; his chest<br>
Against the yielding gate he pressed<br>
And quietly passed through.<br><br>

And up the stony lane he goes;<br>
No ghost more softly ever trod;<br>
Among the stones and pebbles, he<br>
Sets down his hoofs inaudibly,<br>
As if with felt his hoofs were shod.<br><br>

Along the lane the trusty Ass<br>
Went twice two hundred yards or more,<br>
And no one could have guessed his aim,&mdash;<br>
Till to a lonely house he came,<br>
And stopped beside the door.<br><br>

Thought Peter, 'tis the poor man's home!<br>
He listens&mdash;not a sound is heard<br>
Save from the trickling household rill;<br>
But, stepping o'er the cottage-sill,<br>
Forthwith a little Girl appeared.<br><br>

She to the Meeting-house was bound<br>
In hopes some tidings there to gather:<br>
No glimpse it is, no doubtful gleam;<br>
She saw&mdash;and uttered with a scream,<br>
"My father! here's my father!"<br><br>

The very word was plainly heard,<br>
Heard plainly by the wretched Mother&mdash;<br>
Her joy was like a deep affright:<br>
And forth she rushed into the light,<br>
And saw it was another!<br><br>

And, instantly, upon the earth,<br>
Beneath the full moon shining bright,<br>
Close to the Ass's feet she fell;<br>
At the same moment Peter Bell<br>
Dismounts in most unhappy plight.<br><br>

As he beheld the Woman lie<br>
Breathless and motionless, the mind<br>
Of Peter sadly was confused;<br>
But, though to such demands unused,<br>
And helpless almost as the blind,<br><br>

He raised her up; and, while he held<br>
Her body propped against his knee,<br>
The Woman waked&mdash;and when she spied<br>
The poor Ass standing by her side,<br>
She moaned most bitterly.<br><br>

"Oh! God be praised&mdash;my heart's at ease&mdash;<br>
For he is dead&mdash;I know it well!"<br>
&mdash;At this she wept a bitter flood;<br>
And, in the best way that he could,<br>
His tale did Peter tell.<br><br>

He trembles&mdash;he is pale as death;<br>
His voice is weak with perturbation;<br>
He turns aside his head, he pauses;<br>
Poor Peter from a thousand causes,<br>
Is crippled sore in his narration.<br><br>

At length she learned how he espied<br>
The Ass in that small meadow-ground;<br>
And that her Husband now lay dead,<br>
Beside that luckless river's bed<br>
In which he had been drowned.<br><br>

A piercing look the Widow cast<br>
Upon the Beast that near her stands;<br>
She sees 'tis he, that 'tis the same;<br>
She calls the poor Ass by his name,<br>
And wrings, and wrings her hands.<br><br>

"O wretched loss&mdash;untimely stroke!<br>
If he had died upon his bed!<br>
He knew not one forewarning pain;<br>
He never will come home again&mdash;<br>
Is dead, for ever dead!"<br><br>

Beside the Woman Peter stands;<br>
His heart is opening more and more;<br>
A holy sense pervades his mind;<br>
He feels what he for human-kind<br>
Had never felt before.<br><br>

At length, by Peter's arm sustained,<br>
The Woman rises from the ground&mdash;<br>
"Oh, mercy! something must be done,<br>
My little Rachel, you must run,&mdash;<br>
Some willing neighbour must be found.<br><br>

"Make haste&mdash;my little Rachel&mdash;do,<br>
The first you meet with&mdash;bid him come,<br>
Ask him to lend his horse to-night,<br>
And this good Man, whom Heaven requite,<br>
Will help to bring the body home."<br><br>

Away goes Rachel weeping loud;&mdash;<br>
An Infant, waked by her distress,<br>
Makes in the house a piteous cry;<br>
And Peter hears the Mother sigh,<br>
"Seven are they, and all fatherless!"<br><br>

And now is Peter taught to feel<br>
That man's heart is a holy thing;<br>
And Nature, through a world of death,<br>
Breathes into him a second breath,<br>
More searching than the breath of spring.<br><br>

Upon a stone the Woman sits<br>
In agony of silent grief&mdash;<br>
From his own thoughts did Peter start;<br>
He longs to press her to his heart,<br>
From love that cannot find relief.<br><br>

But roused, as if through every limb<br>
Had past a sudden shock of dread,<br>
The Mother o'er the threshold flies,<br>
And up the cottage stairs she hies,<br>
And on the pillow lays her burning head.<br><br>

And Peter turns his steps aside<br>
Into a shade of darksome trees,<br>
Where he sits down, he knows not how,<br>
With his hands pressed against his brow,<br>
His elbows on his tremulous knees.<br><br>

There, self-involved, does Peter sit<br>
Until no sign of life he makes,<br>
As if his mind were sinking deep<br>
Through years that have been long asleep!<br>
The trance is passed away&mdash;he wakes;<br><br>

He lifts his head&mdash;and sees the Ass<br>
Yet standing in the clear moonshine;<br>
"When shall I be as good as thou?<br>
Oh! would, poor beast, that I had now<br>
A heart but half as good as thine!"<br><br>

But <i>He</i>&mdash;who deviously hath sought<br>
His Father through the lonesome woods,<br>
Hath sought, proclaiming to the ear<br>
Of night his grief and sorrowful fear&mdash;<br>
He comes, escaped from fields and floods;&mdash;<br><br>

With weary pace is drawing nigh;<br>
He sees the Ass&mdash;and nothing living<br>
Had ever such a fit of joy<br>
As hath this little orphan Boy,<br>
For he has no misgiving!<br><br>

Forth to the gentle Ass he springs,<br>
And up about his neck he climbs;<br>
In loving words he talks to him,<br>
He kisses, kisses face and limb,&mdash;<br>
He kisses him a thousand times!<br><br>

This Peter sees, while in the shade<br>
He stood beside the cottage-door;<br>
And Peter Bell, the ruffian wild,<br>
Sobs loud, he sobs even like a child,<br>
"Oh! God, I can endure no more!"<br><br>

&mdash;Here ends my Tale: for in a trice<br>
Arrived a neighbour with his horse;<br>
Peter went forth with him straightway;<br>
And, with due care, ere break of day,<br>
Together they brought back the Corse.<br><br>

And many years did this poor Ass,<br>
Whom once it was my luck to see<br>
Cropping the shrubs of Leming-Lane,<br>
Help by his labour to maintain<br>
The Widow and her family. <br><br>

And Peter Bell, who, till that night,<br>
Had been the wildest of his clan,<br>
Forsook his crimes, renounced his folly,<br>
And, after ten months' melancholy,<br>
Became a good and honest man.<br>

<a name="1K"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote K:</span></a> &nbsp;<span style="color: #555555;"> The first and second editions of <i>Peter Bell</i> (1819)
contained, as frontispiece, an engraving by J. C. Bromley, after a
picture by Sir George Beaumont. In 1807, Wordsworth wrote to Sir George:
</span>
 <blockquote> "I am quite delighted to hear of your picture for <i>Peter Bell</i> ....
  But remember that no poem of mine will ever be popular, and I am
  afraid that the sale of <i>Peter</i> would not carry the expense of
  engraving .... The people would love the poem of <i>Peter Bell</i>, but the
  <i>public</i> (a very different thing) will never love it."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Some days before Wordsworth's <i>Peter Bell</i> was issued in 1819, another
'Peter Bell' was published by Messrs. Taylor and Hessey. It was a parody
written by J. Hamilton Reynolds, and issued as 'Peter Bell, a Lyrical
Ballad', with the sentence on its title page, "I do affirm that I am the
<i>real</i> Simon Pure." The preface, which follows, is too paltry to quote;
and the stanzas which make up the poem contain allusions to the more
trivial of the early <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> (Betty Foy, Harry Gill, etc.).
Wordsworth's <i>Peter Bell</i> was published about a week later; and Shelley
afterwards published his<i> Peter Bell the Third</i>. Charles Lamb wrote to
Wordsworth, in May 1819:</span>

  <blockquote>"Dear Wordsworth&mdash;I received a copy of 'Peter Bell' a week ago, and I
  hope the author will not be offended if I say I do not much relish it.
  The humour, if it is meant for humour, is forced; and then the
  price!&mdash;sixpence would have been dear for it. Mind, I do not mean
  <i>your</i> 'Peter Bell', but <i>a Peter Bell</i>, which preceded it about a
  week, and is in every bookseller's shop window in London, the type and
  paper nothing differing from the true one, the preface signed W. W.,
  and the supplementary preface quoting, as the author's words, an
  extract from the supplementary preface to the 'Lyrical Ballads.' Is
  there no law against these rascals? I would have this Lambert Simnel
  whipt at the cart's tail."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">(<i>The Letters of Charles Lamb</i>, edited by
  A. Ainger, vol. ii. p. 20.)<br>
<br>
Barron Field wrote on the title-page of his copy of the edition of
<i>Peter Bell</i>, 1819, </span>

 <blockquote> "And his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it."</blockquote>

<br>
<a name="1fa"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Sub-Footnote a:</span></a> &nbsp;<span style="color: #555555;">This stanza, which was deleted from every edition of
<i>Peter Bell</i> after the two of 1819, was prefixed by Shelley to his poem
of <i>Peter Bell the Third</i>, and many of his contemporaries thought that
it was an invention of Shelley's. See the note which follows this poem,
p. 50. Crabb Robinson wrote in his <i>Diary</i>, June 6, 1812: </span>

 <blockquote> "Mrs. Basil Montagu told me she had no doubt she had suggested this
  image to Wordsworth by relating to him an anecdote. A person, walking
  in a friend's garden, looking in at a window, saw a company of ladies
  at a table near the window, with countenances <i>fixed.</i> In an instant
  he was aware of their condition, and broke the window. He saved them
  from incipient suffocation." </blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Wordsworth subsequently said that he had omitted the stanza only in
deference to the "unco guid." Crabb Robinson remonstrated with him
against its exclusion.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<a href="#section2a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[July 1798. No poem of mine was composed under circumstances more
pleasant for me to remember than this. I began it upon leaving Tintern,
after crossing the Wye, and concluded it just as I was entering Bristol
in the evening, after a ramble of four or five days, with my sister. Not
a line of it was altered, and not any part of it written down till I
reached Bristol. It was published almost immediately after in the little
volume of which so much has been said in these Notes, the <i>Lyrical
Ballads,</i> as first published at Bristol by Cottle.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">Included among the "Poems of the Imagination."&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<td>Five years have past; five summers, with the length<br>
Of five long winters! and again I hear<br>
These waters, rolling from their mountain-springs<br>
With a soft inland murmur.&mdash;Once again<br>
Do I behold these steep and lofty cliffs,                      <br>
That on a wild secluded scene impress<br>
Thoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect<br>
The landscape with the quiet of the sky.<br>
The day is come when I again repose<br>
Here, under this dark sycamore, and view                      <br>
These plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts,<br>
Which at this season, with their unripe fruits,<br>
Are clad in one green hue, and lose themselves<br>
'Mid groves and copses. Once again I see<br>
These hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines             <br>
Of sportive wood run wild: these pastoral farms,<br>
Green to the very door; and wreaths of smoke<br>
Sent up, in silence, from among the trees!<br>
With some uncertain notice, as might seem<br>
Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods,                   <br>
Or of some Hermit's cave, where by his fire<br>
The Hermit sits alone.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These beauteous forms,<br>
Through a long absence, have not been to me<br>
As is a landscape to a blind man's eye:                       <br>
But oft, in lonely rooms, and 'mid the din<br>
Of towns and cities, I have owed to them,<br>
In hours of weariness, sensations sweet,<br>
Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart;<br>
And passing even into my purer mind,                      <br>
With tranquil restoration:&mdash;feelings too<br>
Of unremembered pleasure: such, perhaps,<br>
As have no slight or trivial influence<br>
On that best portion of a good man's life,<br>
His little, nameless, unremembered, acts                      <br>
Of kindness and of love. Nor less, I trust,<br>
To them I may have owed another gift,<br>
Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,<br>
In which the burthen of the mystery,<br>
In which the heavy and the weary weight                       <br>
Of all this unintelligible world,<br>
Is lightened:&mdash;that serene and blessed mood,<br>
In which the affections gently lead us on,&mdash;<br>
Until, the breath of this corporeal frame<br>
And even the motion of our human blood                        <br>
Almost suspended, we are laid asleep<br>
In body, and become a living soul:<br>
While with an eye made quiet by the power<br>
Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,<br>
We see into the life of things.                               <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this<br>
Be but a vain belief, yet, oh! how oft&mdash;<br>
In darkness and amid the many shapes<br>
Of joyless daylight; when the fretful stir<br>
Unprofitable, and the fever of the world,                     <br>
Have hung upon the beatings of my heart&mdash;<br>
How oft, in spirit, have I turned to thee,<br>
O sylvan Wye! thou wanderer thro' the woods,<br>
How often has my spirit turned to thee!<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought,        <br>
With many recognitions dim and faint,<br>
And somewhat of a sad perplexity,<br>
The picture of the mind revives again:<br>
While here I stand, not only with the sense<br>
Of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts               <br>
That in this moment there is life and food<br>
For future years. And so I dare to hope,<br>
Though changed, no doubt, from what I was when first<br>
I came among these hills; when like a roe<br>
I bounded o'er the mountains, by the sides                    <br>
Of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams,<br>
Wherever nature led: more like a man<br>
Flying from something that he dreads, than one<br>
Who sought the thing he loved. For nature then<br>
(The coarser pleasures of my boyish days,                     <br>
And their glad animal movements all gone by)<br>
To me was all in all.&mdash;I cannot paint<br>
What then I was. The sounding cataract<br>
Haunted me like a passion: the tall rock,<br>
The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,                   <br>
Their colours and their forms, were then to me<br>
An appetite; a feeling and a love,<br>
That had no need of a remoter charm,<br>
By thought supplied, nor any interest<br>
Unborrowed from the eye.&mdash;That time is past,                  <br>
And all its aching joys are now no more,<br>
And all its dizzy raptures. Not for this<br>
Faint I, nor mourn nor murmur; other gifts<br>
Have followed; for such loss, I would believe,<br>
Abundant recompence. For I have learned                       <br>
To look on nature, not as in the hour<br>
Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes<br>
The still, sad music of humanity,<br>
Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power<br>
To chasten and subdue. And I have felt                        <br>
A presence that disturbs me with the joy<br>
Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime<br>
Of something far more deeply interfused,<br>
Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,<br>
And the round ocean and the living air,                      <br>
And the blue sky, and in the mind of man:<br>
A motion and a spirit, that impels<br>
All thinking things, all objects of all thought,<br>
And rolls through all things. Therefore am I still<br>
A lover of the meadows and the woods,                        <br>
And mountains; and of all that we behold<br>
From this green earth; of all the mighty world<br>
Of eye, and ear,&mdash;both what they half create,<br>
And what perceive; well pleased to recognise<br>
In nature and the language of the sense,                     <br>
The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,<br>
The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul<br>
Of all my moral being.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor perchance,<br>
If I were not thus taught, should I the more                 <br>
Suffer my genial spirits to decay:<br>
For thou art with me here upon the banks<br>
Of this fair river; thou my dearest Friend,<br>
My dear, dear Friend; and in thy voice I catch<br>
The language of my former heart, and read                    <br>
My former pleasures in the shooting lights<br>
Of thy wild eyes, Oh! yet a little while<br>
May I behold in thee what I was once,<br>
My dear, dear Sister! and this prayer I make,<br>
Knowing that Nature never did betray                         <br>
The heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege,<br>
Through all the years of this our life, to lead<br>
From joy to joy: for she can so inform<br>
The mind that is within us, so impress<br>
With quietness and beauty, and so feed                       <br>
With lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues,<br>
Rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men,<br>
Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all<br>
The dreary intercourse of daily life,<br>
Shall e'er prevail against us, or disturb                    <br>
Our cheerful faith, that all which we behold<br>
Is full of blessings. Therefore let the moon<br>
Shine on thee in thy solitary walk;<br>
And let the misty mountain-winds be free<br>
To blow against thee: and, in after years,                   <br>
When these wild ecstasies shall be matured<br>
Into a sober pleasure; when thy mind<br>
Shall be a mansion for all lovely forms,<br>
Thy memory be as a dwelling-place<br>
For all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then,                <br>
If solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,<br>
Should be thy portion, with what healing thoughts<br>
Of tender joy wilt thou remember me,<br>
And these my exhortations! Nor, perchance&mdash;<br>
If I should be where I no more can hear                      <br>
Thy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams<br>
Of past existence&mdash;wilt thou then forget<br>
That on the banks of this delightful stream<br>
We stood together; and that I, so long<br>
A worshipper of Nature, hither came                          <br>
Unwearied in that service: rather say<br>
With warmer love&mdash;oh! with far deeper zeal<br>
Of holier love. Nor wilt thou then forget,<br>
That after many wanderings, many years<br>
Of absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs,              <br>
And this green pastoral landscape, were to me<br>
More dear, both for themselves and for thy sake!<br>

<h4>Composed 1798.&mdash;Published 1800</h4>

<a href="#section3a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[Written in Germany, 1799. This is an extract from the Poem on my own
poetical education. This practice of making an instrument of their own
fingers is known to most boys, though some are more skilful at it than
others. William Raincock of Rayrigg, a fine spirited lad, took the lead
of all my schoolfellows in this art.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">This "extract" will be found in the fifth book of <i>The Prelude</i>, ll.
364-397. It was included among the "Poems of the Imagination." In the
editions of 1800 to 1832 it had no title, except in the table of
contents. In 1836, the finally adopted title of the poem was given in
the text, as well as in the table of contents.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<td>There was a Boy; ye knew him well, ye cliffs<br>
And islands of Winander!&mdash;many a time,<br>
At evening, when the earliest stars began<br>
To move along the edges of the hills,<br>
Rising or setting, would he stand alone,                        <br>
Beneath the trees, or by the glimmering lake;<br>
And there, with fingers interwoven, both hands<br>
Pressed closely palm to palm and to his mouth<br>
Uplifted, he, as through an instrument,<br>
Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls,                        <br>
That they might answer him.&mdash;And they would shout<br>
Across the watery vale, and shout again,<br>
Responsive to his call,&mdash;with quivering peals,<br>
And long halloos, and screams, and echoes loud<br>
Redoubled and redoubled; concourse wild                        <br>
Of jocund din! And, when there came a pause<br>
Of silence such as baffled his best skill:<br>
Then, sometimes, in that silence, while he hung<br>
Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprise<br>
Has carried far into his heart the voice                       <br>
Of mountain-torrents; or the visible scene<br>
Would enter unawares into his mind<br>
With all its solemn imagery, its rocks,<br>
Its woods, and that uncertain heaven received<br>
Into the bosom of the steady lake. <br>
                            <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This boy was taken from his mates, and died<br>
In childhood, ere he was full twelve years old.<br>
Pre-eminent in beauty is the vale<br>
Where he was born and bred: the church-yard hangs<br>
Upon a slope above the village-school;                         <br>
And, through that church-yard when my way has led<br>
On summer-evenings, I believe, that there<br>
A long half-hour together I have stood<br>
Mute&mdash;looking at the grave in which he lies!<br>

<a name="3n1"></a><span style="color: #555555;">Wordsworth sent this fragment in MS. to Coleridge, who was then living
at Ratzeburg, and Coleridge wrote in reply on the 10th Dec. 1798:</span>

 <blockquote> "The blank lines gave me as much direct pleasure as was possible in
  the general bustle of pleasure with which I received and read your
  letter. I observed, I remember, that the 'fingers woven,' etc., only
  puzzled me; and though I liked the twelve or fourteen first lines very
  well, yet I liked the remainder much better. Well, now I have read
  them again, they are very beautiful, and leave an affecting
  impression. That

  <blockquote>  'uncertain heaven received<br>
    Into the bosom of the steady lake,'</blockquote>

  I should have recognised anywhere; and had I met these lines, running
  wild in the deserts of Arabia, I should have instantly screamed out
  'Wordsworth'!"</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The MS. copy of this poem sent to Coleridge probably lacked
the explanatory line,</span>

 <blockquote> 'Pressed closely palm to palm and to his mouth,'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">as another MS., in the possession of the poet's grandson, lacks it; and
the line was possibly added&mdash;as the late Mr. Dykes Campbell
suggested&mdash;"in deference to S. T. C.'s expression of puzzlement."<br>
<br>
Fletcher <a name="fr3B">Raincock&mdash;an</a> elder brother of the William Raincock referred to
in the Fenwick note to this poem, as Wordsworth's schoolfellow at
Hawkshead&mdash;was with him also at Cambridge. He attended Pembroke College,
and was second wrangler in 1790<a href="#3B"><sup>B</sup></a>. John Fleming of Rayrigg, his
half-brother&mdash;the boy with whom Wordsworth used to walk round the lake
of Esthwaite, in the morning before school-time, ("five miles of
pleasant wandering")&mdash;was also at St. John's College, Cambridge, at this
time, and had been fifth Wrangler in the preceding year, 1789. He is
referred to both in the second and the fifth books of <i>The Prelude</i>
(see notes to that poem). It is perhaps not unworthy of note that
Wrangham, whose French stanzas on "The Birth of Love" Wordsworth
translated into English, was in the same year&mdash;1789&mdash;third Wrangler,
second Smith's prizeman, and first Chancellor's medallist; while Robert
Greenwood, "the Minstrel of the Troop," who "blew his flute, alone upon
the rock" in Windermere,&mdash;also one of the characters referred to in the
second book of <i>The Prelude</i>,&mdash;was sixteenth Wrangler in
Wordsworth's year, viz. 1791. William Raincock was at St. John's
College, Cambridge.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<td>O now that the genius of Bewick were mine,<br>
And the skill which he learned on the banks of the Tyne,<br>
Then the Muses might deal with me just as they chose,<br>
For I'd take my last leave both of verse and of prose.<br><br>

What feats would I work with my magical hand!                     <br>
Book-learning and books should be banished the land:<br>
And, for hunger and thirst and such troublesome calls,<br>
Every ale-house should then have a feast on its walls.<br><br>

The traveller would hang his wet clothes on a chair;<br>
Let them smoke, let them burn, not a straw would he care!        <br>
For the Prodigal Son, Joseph's Dream and his sheaves,<br>
Oh, what would they be to my tale of two Thieves?<br><br>

The One, yet unbreeched, is not three birthdays old,<br>
His Grandsire that age more than thirty times told;<br>
There are ninety good seasons of fair and foul weather           <br>
Between them, and both go a-pilfering together.<br><br>

With chips is the carpenter strewing his floor?<br>
Is a cart-load of turf at an old woman's door?<br>
Old Daniel his hand to the treasure will slide!<br>
And his Grandson's as busy at work by his side.                  <br><br>

Old Daniel begins; he stops short&mdash;and his eye,<br>
Through the lost look of dotage, is cunning and sly:<br>
'Tis a look which at this time is hardly his own,<br>
But tells a plain tale of the days that are flown.<br><br>

He once had a heart which was moved by the wires             <br>
Of manifold pleasures and many desires:<br>
And what if he cherished his purse? 'Twas no more<br>
Than treading a path trod by thousands before.<br><br>

'Twas a path trod by thousands; but Daniel is one<br>
Who went something farther than others have gone,            <br>
And now with old Daniel you see how it fares;<br>
You see to what end he has brought his grey hairs.<br><br>

The pair sally forth hand in hand: ere the sun<br>
Has peered o'er the beeches, their work is begun:<br>
And yet, into whatever sin they may fall,                        <br>
This child but half knows it, and that not at all.<br><br>

They hunt through the streets with deliberate tread,<br>
And each, in his turn, becomes leader or led;<br>
And, wherever they carry their plots and their wiles,<br>
Every face in the village is dimpled with smiles.                <br><br>

Neither checked by the rich nor the needy they roam;<br>
For the grey-headed Sire has a daughter at home,<br>
Who will gladly repair all the damage that's done;<br>
And three, were it asked, would be rendered for one.<br><br>

Old Man! whom so oft I with pity have eyed,                      <br>
I love thee, and love the sweet Boy at thy side:<br>
Long yet may'st thou live! for a teacher we see<br>
That lifts up the veil of our nature in thee.<br>

<td>Stranger! this hillock of mis-shapen stones                   <br>
Is not a Ruin spared or made by time,<br>
Nor, as perchance thou rashly deem'st, the Cairn<br>
Of some old British Chief: 'tis nothing more<br>
Than the rude embryo of a little Dome                          <br>
Or Pleasure-house, once destined to be built<br>
Among the birch-trees of this rocky isle.<br>
But, as it chanced, Sir William having learned<br>
That from the shore a full-grown man might wade,<br>
And make himself a freeman of this spot                       <br>
At any hour he chose, the prudent Knight<br>
Desisted, and the quarry and the mound<br>
Are monuments of his unfinished task.<br>
The block on which these lines are traced, perhaps,<br>
Was once selected as the corner-stone                         <br>
Of that intended Pile, which would have been<br>
Some quaint odd plaything of elaborate skill,<br>
So that, I guess, the linnet and the thrush,<br>
And other little builders who dwell here,<br>
Had wondered at the work. But blame him not,                  <br>
For old Sir William was a gentle Knight,<br>
Bred in this vale, to which he appertained<br>
With all his ancestry. Then peace to him,<br>
And for the outrage which he had devised<br>
Entire forgiveness!&mdash;But if thou art one                      <br>
On fire with thy impatience to become<br>
An inmate of these mountains,&mdash;if, disturbed<br>
By beautiful conceptions, thou hast hewn<br>
Out of the quiet rock the elements<br>
Of thy trim Mansion destined soon to blaze                    <br>
In snow-white splendour,&mdash;think again; and, taught<br>
By old Sir William and his quarry, leave<br>
Thy fragments to the bramble and the rose;<br>
There let the vernal slow-worm sun himself,<br>
And let the redbreast hop from stone to stone.<br>

<h2><a name="section6"></a>1799</h2>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">The poems belonging to the year 1799 were chiefly, if not wholly,
composed at Goslar, in Germany; and all, with three exceptions, appeared
in the second edition of <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> (1800). The exceptions were
the following:</span>
<ul>
  <li><span style="color: #555555;">The lyric beginning, "I travelled among unknown men," which was first
  published in the "Poems" of 1807;</span></li>

  <li><span style="color: #555555;">and two fragments from <i>The Prelude</i>, viz. <i>The Influence of
  Natural Objects</i> (which appeared in <i>The Friend</i> in 1809), and
  <i>The Simplon Pass</i> (first published in the 8vo edition of the
  Poems in 1845).</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color: #555555;">Wordsworth reached Goslar on the 6th of October 1798, and left it on the
10th of February 1799. It is impossible to determine the precise order
in which the nineteen or twenty poems associated with that city were
composed. But it is certain that the fragment on the immortal boy of
Windermere &mdash;whom its cliffs and islands knew so well&mdash;was written in
1798, and not in 1799 (as Wordsworth himself states); because Coleridge
sent a letter to his friend, thanking him for a MS. copy of these lines,
and commenting on them, of which the date is "Ratzeburg, Dec. 10, 1798."
For obvious reasons, however, I place the fragments originally meant to
be parts of <i>The Recluse</i> together; and, since Wordsworth gave the
date 1799 to the others, it would be gratuitous to suppose that he erred
in reference to them all, because we know that his memory failed him in
reference to one of the series. Therefore, although he spent more than
twice as many days in 1798 as in 1799 at Goslar, I set down this group
of poems as belonging to 1799, rather than to the previous year. It will
be seen that, after placing all the poems of this Goslar period in the
year to which they belong, it is possible also to group them according
to their subject matter, without violating chronological order. I
therefore put the fragments, afterwards incorporated in <i>The
Prelude</i>, together. These are naturally followed by <i>Nutting</i>&mdash;a
poem intended for <i>The Prelude</i>, but afterwards excluded, as
inappropriate. The five poems referring to "Lucy" are placed in
sequence, and the same is done with the four "Matthew" poems. A small
group of four poems follows appropriately, viz. <i>To a Sexton, The
Danish Boy, Lucy Gray</i>, and <i>Ruth</i>; while the Fenwick note
almost necessitates our placing the <i>Poet's Epitaph</i> immediately
after the Lines <i>Written in Germany</i>; and, with Wordsworth's life
at Goslar, we naturally associate five things&mdash;the cold winter, <i>The
Prelude</i>, the "Lucy" and the "Matthew" poems, and the <i>Poet's
Epitaph</i>.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<td>Wisdom and Spirit of the universe!                         <br>
Thou Soul, that art the Eternity of thought!<br>
And giv'st to forms and images a breath<br>
And everlasting motion! not in vain,<br>
By day or star-light, thus from my first dawn              <br>
Of childhood didst thou intertwine for me<br>
The passions that build up our human soul;<br>
Not with the mean and vulgar works of Man:<br>
But with high objects, with enduring things,<br>
With life and nature: purifying thus                      <br>
The elements of feeling and of thought,<br>
And sanctifying by such discipline<br>
Both pain and fear,&mdash;until we recognise<br>
A grandeur in the beatings of the heart.<br><br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me                <br>
With stinted kindness. In November days,<br>
When vapours rolling down the valleys made<br>
A lonely scene more lonesome; among woods<br>
At noon; and 'mid the calm of summer nights,<br>
When, by the margin of the trembling lake,                <br>
Beneath the gloomy hills, homeward I went<br>
In solitude, such intercourse was mine:<br>
Mine was it in the fields both day and night,<br>
And by the waters, all the summer long.<br>
And in the frosty season, when the sun                    <br>
Was set, and, visible for many a mile,<br>
The cottage-windows through the twilight blazed,<br>
I heeded not the summons: happy time<br>
It was indeed for all of us; for me<br>
It was a time of rapture! Clear and loud                  <br>
The village-clock tolled six&mdash;I wheeled about,<br>
Proud and exulting like an untired horse<br>
That cares not for his home.&mdash;All shod with steel<br>
We hissed along the polished ice, in games<br>
Confederate, imitative of the chase                       <br>
And woodland pleasures,&mdash;the resounding horn,<br>
The pack loud-chiming, and the hunted hare.<br>
So through the darkness and the cold we flew,<br>
And not a voice was idle: with the din<br>
Smitten, the precipices rang aloud;                  <br>
The leafless trees and every icy crag<br>
Tinkled like iron; while far-distant hills<br>
Into the tumult sent an alien sound<br>
Of melancholy, not unnoticed while the stars,<br>
Eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west           <br>
The orange sky of evening died away.<br><br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not seldom from the uproar I retired<br>
Into a silent bay, or sportively<br>
Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng,<br>
To cut across the reflex of a star;                  <br>
Image, that, flying still before me, gleamed<br>
Upon the glassy plain: and oftentimes,<br>
When we had given our bodies to the wind,<br>
And all the shadowy banks on either side<br>
Came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still        <br>
The rapid line of motion, then at once<br>
Have I, reclining back upon my heels,<br>
Stopped short; yet still the solitary cliffs<br>
Wheeled by me&mdash;even as if the earth had rolled<br>
With visible motion her diurnal round!                    <br>
Behind me did they stretch in solemn train,<br>
Feebler and feebler, and I stood and watched<br>
Till all was tranquil as a summer sea.<br>

No. 19, (Dec. 28, 1809,) was <i>Growth of Genius from the Influences of
Natural Objects on the Imagination, in Boyhood and Early Youth</i>. It
first appeared in Wordsworth's <i>Poems</i> in the edition of 1815. It was
afterwards included in the first book of <i>The Prelude</i>, l. 401.<br>
<br>
The lake referred to with its "silent bays" and "shadowy banks" is that
of Esthwaite; the village clock is that of Hawkshead (see the footnotes
to <i>The Prelude</i>). The only physical accomplishment in which Wordsworth
thought he excelled was skating, an accomplishment in which his brother
poet and acquaintance, Klopstock, also excelled.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

The stationary blasts of waterfalls,<br>

Winds thwarting winds bewildered and forlorn,<br>
The torrents shooting from the clear blue sky,<br>
The rocks that muttered close upon our ears,                  <br>
Black drizzling crags that spake by the wayside<br>
As if a voice were in them, the sick sight<br>
And giddy prospect of the raving stream,<br>
The unfettered clouds and region of the heavens,<br>
Tumult and peace, the darkness and the light&mdash;                <br>
Were all like workings of one mind, the features<br>
Of the same face, blossoms upon one tree,<br>
Characters of the great Apocalypse,<br>
The types and symbols of Eternity,<br>
Of first, and last, and midst, and without end.<br>

<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[Written in Germany; intended as part of a poem on my own life, but
struck out as not being wanted there. Like most of my schoolfellows I
was an impassioned Nutter. For this pleasure, the Vale of Esthwaite,
abounding in coppice wood, furnished a very wide range. These verses
arose out of the remembrance of feelings I had often had when a boy, and
particularly in the extensive woods that still stretch from the side of
Esthwaite Lake towards Graythwaite, the seat of the ancient family of
Sandys.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;It seems a day                                              <br>
(I speak of one from many singled out)<br>
One of those heavenly days that cannot die;<br>
When, in the eagerness of boyish hope,<br>
I left our cottage-threshold, sallying forth                <br>
With a huge wallet o'er my shoulders slung,<br>
A nutting-crook in hand; and turned my steps<br>
Tow'rd some far-distant wood, a Figure quaint,<br>
Tricked out in proud disguise of cast-off weeds<br>
Which for that service had been husbanded,                         <br>
By exhortation of my frugal Dame&mdash;<br>
Motley accoutrement, of power to smile<br>
At thorns, and brakes, and brambles,&mdash;and, in truth,<br>
More ragged than need was! O'er pathless rocks,<br>
Through beds of matted fern, and tangled thickets,                 <br>
Forcing my way, I came to one dear nook<br>
Unvisited, where not a broken bough<br>
Drooped with its withered leaves, ungracious sign<br>
Of devastation; but the hazels rose<br>
Tall and erect, with tempting clusters hung,                   <br>
A virgin scene!&mdash;A little while I stood,<br>
Breathing with such suppression of the heart<br>
As joy delights in; and, with wise restraint<br>
Voluptuous, fearless of a rival, eyed<br>
The banquet;&mdash;or beneath the trees I sate                          <br>
Among the flowers, and with the flowers I played;<br>
A temper known to those, who, after long<br>
And weary expectation, have been blest<br>
With sudden happiness beyond all hope.<br>
Perhaps it was a bower beneath whose leaves                        <br>
The violets of five seasons re-appear<br>
And fade, unseen by any human eye;<br>
Where fairy water-breaks do murmur on<br>
For ever; and I saw the sparkling foam,<br>
And&mdash;with my cheek on one of those green stones                    <br>
That, fleeced with moss, under the shady trees,<br>
Lay round me, scattered like a flock of sheep&mdash;<br>
I heard the murmur and the murmuring sound,<br>
In that sweet mood when pleasure loves to pay<br>
Tribute to ease; and, of its joy secure,                           <br>
The heart luxuriates with indifferent things,<br>
Wasting its kindliness on stocks and stones,<br>
And on the vacant air. Then up I rose,<br>
And dragged to earth both branch and bough, with crash<br>
And merciless ravage: and the shady nook                           <br>
Of hazels, and the green and mossy bower,<br>
Deformed and sullied, patiently gave up<br>
Their quiet being: and, unless I now<br>
Confound my present feelings with the past;<br>
Ere from the mutilated bower I turned                         <br>
Exulting, rich beyond the wealth of kings,<br>
I felt a sense of pain when I beheld<br>
The silent trees, and saw the intruding sky.&mdash;<br>
Then, dearest Maiden, move along these shades<br>
In gentleness of heart; with gentle hand                           <br>
Touch&mdash;for there is a spirit in the woods.<br>

<h2><a name="section10"></a>Written in Germany, on one of the Coldest Days of the Century</h2>

<h4>Composed 1799.&mdash;Published 1800</h4>

<a href="#section10a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
I must apprize the Reader that the stoves in North Germany generally
have the impression of a galloping Horse upon them, this being part of
the Brunswick Arms.&mdash;W. W. 1800.<br>
<br>
<a name="10f1"></a><span style="color: #663300;">[A bitter winter it was when these verses were composed by the side of
my sister, in our lodgings at a draper's house, in the romantic imperial
town of Goslar, on the edge of the Hartz Forest. In this town the German
emperors of the Franconian Line were accustomed to keep their court, and
it retains vestiges of ancient splendour. So severe was the cold of this
winter, that when we passed out of the parlour warmed by the stove, our
cheeks were struck by the air as by cold iron. I slept in a room over a
passage that was not ceiled. The people of the house used to say rather
unfeelingly, that they expected I should be frozen to death some night;
but with the protection of a pelisse lined with fur, and a dog's skin
bonnet, such as was worn by the peasants, I walked daily on the
ramparts, or on a sort of public ground or garden, in which was a pond.
Here I had no companion but a kingfisher, a beautiful creature that used
to glance by me. I consequently became much attached to it. During these
walks I composed the poem that follows, <i>A Poet's Epitaph</i>.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>

<td>A plague on your languages, German and Norse!                 <br>
Let me have the song of the kettle;<br>
And the tongs and the poker, instead of that horse<br>
That gallops away with such fury and force<br>
On this dreary dull plate of black metal.                         <br>
<br>
See that Fly,&mdash;a disconsolate creature! perhaps<br>
A child of the field or the grove;<br>
And, sorrow for him! the dull treacherous heat<br>
Has seduced the poor fool from his winter retreat,<br>
And he creeps to the edge of my stove.   <br>
                            <br>
Alas! how he fumbles about the domains<br>
Which this comfortless oven environ!<br>
He cannot find out in what track he must crawl,<br>
Now back to the tiles, then in search of the wall,<br>
And now on the brink of the iron.        <br>
                            <br>
Stock-still there he stands like a traveller bemazed:<br>
The best of his skill he has tried;<br>
His feelers, methinks, I can see him put forth<br>
To the east and the west, to the south and the north<br>
But he finds neither guide-post nor guide.     <br>
                      <br>
His spindles sink under him, foot, leg, and thigh!<br>
His eyesight and hearing are lost;<br>
Between life and death his blood freezes and thaws;<br>
And his two pretty pinions of blue dusky gauze<br>
Are glued to his sides by the frost.       <br>
                          <br>
No brother, no mate has he near him&mdash;while I<br>
Can draw warmth from the cheek of my Love;<br>
As blest and as glad, in this desolate gloom,<br>
As if green summer grass were the floor of my room,<br>
And woodbines were hanging above.       <br>
                             <br>
Yet, God is my witness, thou small helpless Thing!<br>
Thy life I would gladly sustain<br>
Till summer come up from the south, and with crowds<br>
Of thy brethren a march thou should'st sound through the clouds.<br>
And back to the forests again!<br>

<td>Art thou a Statist in the van                         <br>
Of public conflicts trained and bred?<br>

<i>Then</i> may'st thou think upon the dead.<br><br>

A Lawyer art thou?&mdash;draw not nigh!                           <br>

A rosy Man, right plump to see?                           <br>
Approach; yet, Doctor, not too near,<br>
This grave no cushion is for thee.<br><br>

Or art thou one of gallant pride,<br>
A Soldier and no man of chaff?<br>

Wrapt closely in thy sensual fleece,<br>

A Moralist perchance appears;                             <br>
Led, Heaven knows how! to this poor sod:<br>
And he has neither eyes nor ears;<br>
Himself his world, and his own God;<br><br>

One to whose smooth-rubbed soul can cling<br>
Nor form, nor feeling, great or small;                <br>
A reasoning, self-sufficing thing,<br>
An intellectual All-in-all!<br><br>

Shut close the door; press down the latch;<br>
Sleep in thy intellectual crust;<br>
Nor lose ten tickings of thy watch                        <br>
Near this unprofitable dust.<br><br>

But who is He, with modest looks,<br>
And clad in homely russet brown?<br>
He murmurs near the running brooks<br>
A music sweeter than their own.                           <br><br>

He is retired as noontide dew,<br>
Or fountain in a noon-day grove;<br>
And you must love him, ere to you<br>
He will seem worthy of your love.<br><br>

The outward shows of sky and earth,                       <br>
Of hill and valley, he has viewed;<br>
And impulses of deeper birth<br>
Have come to him in solitude.<br><br>

In common things that round us lie<br>
Some random truths he can impart,&mdash;                       <br>
The harvest of a quiet eye<br>
That broods and sleeps on his own heart.<br><br>

But he is weak; both Man and Boy,<br>
Hath been an idler in the land;<br>
Contented if he might enjoy                               <br>
The things which others understand.<br><br>

&mdash;Come hither in thy hour of strength;<br>
Come, weak as is a breaking wave!<br>
Here stretch thy body at full length;<br>
Or build thy house upon this grave.<br>

<td>Strange fits of passion have I known:                  <br>
And I will dare to tell,<br>
But in the Lover's ear alone,<br>
What once to me befel.<br><br>

When she I loved looked every day                         <br>
Fresh as a rose in June,<br>
I to her cottage bent my way,<br>
Beneath an evening moon.<br><br>

Upon the moon I fixed my eye,<br>
All over the wide lea;                                   <br>
With quickening pace my horse drew nigh<br>
Those paths so dear to me.<br><br>

And now we reached the orchard-plot;<br>
And, as we climbed the hill,<br>
The sinking moon to Lucy's cot                           <br>
Came near, and nearer still.<br><br>

In one of those sweet dreams I slept,<br>
Kind Nature's gentlest boon!<br>
And all the while my eyes I kept<br>
On the descending moon.                                  <br><br>

My horse moved on; hoof after hoof<br>
He raised, and never stopped:<br>
When down behind the cottage roof,<br>
At once, the bright moon dropped.<br><br>

What fond and wayward thoughts will slide                <br>
Into a Lover's head!<br>
"O mercy!" to myself I cried,<br>
"If Lucy should be dead!"<br>

To her; and she shall lean her ear<br>
In many a secret place<br>
Where rivulets dance their wayward round,<br>
And beauty born of murmuring sound<br>
Shall pass into her face.                             <br><br>

"And vital feelings of delight<br>
Shall rear her form to stately height,<br>
Her virgin bosom swell;<br>
Such thoughts to Lucy I will give<br>
While she and I together live                         <br>
Here in this happy dell."<br><br>

Thus Nature spake&mdash;The work was done&mdash;<br>
How soon my Lucy's race was run!<br>
She died, and left to me<br>
This heath, this calm, and quiet scene;               <br>
The memory of what has been,<br>
And never more will be.<br>

<td>I come, ye little noisy Crew,<br>
Not long your pastime to prevent;<br>
I heard the blessing which to you<br>
Our common Friend and Father sent.<br>
I kissed his cheek before he died;                     <br>
And when his breath was fled,<br>
I raised, while kneeling by his side,<br>
His hand:&mdash;it dropped like lead.<br>
Your hands, dear Little-ones, do all<br>
That can be done, will never fall                     <br>
Like his till they are dead.<br>
By night or day blow foul or fair,<br>
Ne'er will the best of all your train<br>
Play with the locks of his white hair,<br>
Or stand between his knees again.   <br>
<br>
  Here did he sit confined for hours;<br>
But he could see the woods and plains,<br>
Could hear the wind and mark the showers<br>
Come streaming down the streaming panes.<br>
Now stretched beneath his grass-green mound           <br>
He rests a prisoner of the ground.<br>
He loved the breathing air,<br>
He loved the sun, but if it rise<br>
Or set, to him where now he lies,<br>
Brings not a moment's care. <br><br>

Alas! what idle words; but take<br>
The Dirge which for our Master's sake<br>
And yours, love prompted me to make.<br>
The rhymes so homely in attire<br>
With learned ears may ill agree,                      <br>
But chanted by your Orphan Quire<br>
Will make a touching melody.<br>
<br><br>

<b>Dirge</b><br><br>

Mourn, Shepherd, near thy old grey stone;<br>
Thou Angler, by the silent flood;<br>
And mourn when thou art all alone,                    <br>
Thou Woodman, in the distant wood!<br><br>

Thou one blind Sailor, rich in joy<br>
Though blind, thy tunes in sadness hum;<br>
And mourn, thou poor half-witted Boy!<br>
Born deaf, and living deaf and dumb. <br><br>

Thou drooping sick Man, bless the Guide<br>
Who checked or turned thy headstrong youth,<br>
As he before had sanctified<br>
Thy infancy with heavenly truth.<br><br>

Ye Striplings, light of heart and gay,                <br>
Bold settlers on some foreign shore,<br>
Give, when your thoughts are turned this way,<br>
A sigh to him whom we deplore.<br><br>

For us who here in funeral strain<br>
With one accord our voices raise,                     <br>
Let sorrow overcharged with pain<br>
Be lost in thankfulness and praise.<br><br>

And when our hearts shall feel a sting<br>
From ill we meet or good we miss,<br>
May touches of his memory bring                       <br>
Fond healing, like a mother's kiss.<br>
<br><br>

<b>By the Side of the Grave Some Years After</b><br><br>

Long time his pulse hath ceased to beat;<br>
But benefits, his gift, we trace&mdash;<br>
Expressed in every eye we meet<br>
Round this dear Vale, his native place. <br><br>

To stately Hall and Cottage rude<br>
Flowed from his life what still they hold,<br>
Light pleasures, every day, renewed;<br>
And blessings half a century old.<br><br>

Oh true of heart, of spirit gay,<br>
Thy faults, where not already gone<br>
From memory, prolong their stay<br>
For charity's sweet sake alone.<br><br>

Such solace find we for our loss;<br>
And what beyond this thought we crave<br>
Comes in the promise from the Cross,<br>
Shining upon thy happy grave.<br>

<a name="17n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp;<span style="color: #555555;">To this poem, when first published in the "Poems of Early and Late
Years" (1842), Wordsworth appended the note, </span>

<blockquote>"See, upon the subject of
the three foregoing pieces, <i>The Fountain</i> [p. 91], etc. etc. in
the fifth volume of the Author's Poems." </blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">He thus connects it with the
poems referring to Matthew in such a way that it may be said to belong
to that series; and, while he assigned it to the year 1798, both in the
edition of 1845, and in that of 1849-50, it is quite possible that it
was written in 1799. "The village school" was the Grammar School of
Hawkshead, where Wordsworth spent his boyhood; and the schoolmaster was
the Rev. William Taylor, M. A., Emmanuel College, Cambridge, who was the
third of the four masters who taught in it during Wordsworth's residence
there. He was master from 1782 to 1786. Just before his death he sent
for the upper boys of the school (amongst whom was Wordsworth), and
calling them into his room, took leave of them with a solemn blessing.
This farewell doubtless suggested the lines:</span>

        <blockquote> the blessing which to you<br>
  Our common Friend and Father sent.</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Mr. Taylor was buried in Cartmell Churchyard. In <i>The Prelude</i>,
Wordsworth writes of him as "an honoured teacher of my youth;" and there
describes, with some minuteness, a visit to his grave. (See book x. l.
532.) It will be seen, however, from the Fenwick note to <a href="#section18"><i>Matthew</i></a>, that
the Hawkshead Schoolmaster, like the Wanderer in <i>The Excursion</i>, was
"made up of several both of his class and men of other occupations;" but
of the four masters who taught Wordsworth at Hawkshead&mdash;Peake,
Christian, Taylor, and Bowman&mdash;Taylor was far the ablest, the most
interesting, and the most beloved by the boys, and it was doubtless the
memory of this man that gave rise to the above poem, and the four which
follow it. He was but thirty-two years old when he died, 12th June,
1786. This fact, taken in connection with line 14 of the <i>Address</i>, may
illustrate the composite character of <i>Matthew.&mdash;Ed.</i></span><br>

In the School of&mdash;is a tablet on which are inscribed, in gilt letters,
the names of the several persons who have been Schoolmasters there since
the foundation of the School, with the time at which they entered upon
and quitted their office. Opposite one of those names the Author wrote
the following lines.&mdash;W. W. 1800.<br>
<br>
<a name="fr18A"></a><span style="color: #663300;">[Such a tablet as is here spoken of continued to be preserved in
Hawkshead School, though the inscriptions were not brought down to our
time. This, and other poems connected with Matthew, would not gain by a
literal detail of facts. Like the Wanderer in <i>The Excursion</i> this
Schoolmaster was made up of several, both of his class and men of other
occupations. I do not ask pardon for what there is of untruth in such
verses, considered strictly as matters of fact. It is enough, if, being
true and consistent in spirit, they move and teach in a manner not
unworthy of a Poet's calling.&mdash;I. F.]<a href="#18A"><sup>A</sup></a></span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">In the editions of 1800 to 1820 this poem had no title except the note
prefixed to it above, although in the Table of Contents it was called
<i>Lines written on a Tablet in a School</i>. From 1820-32 "Matthew" is
the page heading, though there is no title. In the editions of 1827 and
1832 it was named, in the Table of Contents, by its first line, "If
Nature, for a favourite child." In 1837 it was entitled <i>Matthew</i>.
It was included among the "Poems of Sentiment and Reflection." The
Tablet, with the names of the Masters inscribed on it, still exists in
Hawkshead School.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

A day among the hills.<br><br>

"Our work," said I, "was well begun,<br>
Then, from thy breast what thought,<br>
Beneath so beautiful a sun,                             <br>
So sad a sigh has brought?"<br><br>

A second time did Matthew stop;<br>
And fixing still his eye<br>
Upon the eastern mountain-top,<br>
To me he made reply: <br><br>

"Yon cloud with that long purple cleft<br>
Brings fresh into my mind<br>
A day like this which I have left<br>
Full thirty years behind.<br><br>

"And just above yon slope of corn                       <br>
Such colours, and no other,<br>
Were in the sky, that April morn,<br>
Of this the very brother.<br><br>

"With rod and line I sued the sport<br>
Which that sweet season gave,                       <br>
And, to the church-yard come, stopped short<br>
Beside my daughter's grave.<br><br>

"Nine summers had she scarcely seen,<br>
The pride of all the vale;<br>
And then she sang;&mdash;she would have been             <br>
A very nightingale.<br><br>

"Six feet in earth my Emma lay;<br>
And yet I loved her more,<br>
For so it seemed, than till that day<br>
I e'er had loved before. <br><br>

"And, turning from her grave, I met,<br>
Beside the church-yard yew,<br>
A blooming Girl, whose hair was wet<br>
With points of morning dew.<br><br>

"A basket on her head she bare;                         <br>
Her brow was smooth and white:<br>
To see a child so very fair,<br>
It was a pure delight!<br><br>

"No fountain from its rocky cave<br>
E'er tripped with foot so free;                         <br>
She seemed as happy as a wave<br>
That dances on the sea.<br><br>

"There came from me a sigh of pain<br>
Which I could ill confine;<br>
I looked at her, and looked again:                      <br>
And did not wish her mine!"<br><br>

Matthew is in his grave, yet now,<br>
Methinks, I see him stand,<br>
As at that moment, with a bough<br>
Of wilding in his hand. <br>

<td>We talked with open heart, and tongue<br>
Affectionate and true,<br>
A pair of friends, though I was young,<br>
And Matthew seventy-two.<br><br>

We lay beneath a spreading oak,                        <br>
Beside a mossy seat;<br>
And from the turf a fountain broke,<br>
And gurgled at our feet.<br><br>

"Now, Matthew!" said I, "let us match<br>
This water's pleasant tune                            <br>
With some old border-song, or catch<br>
That suits a summer's noon;<br><br>

"Or of the church-clock and the chimes<br>
Sing here beneath the shade,<br>
That half-mad thing of witty rhymes                   <br>
Which you last April made!"<br><br>

In silence Matthew lay, and eyed<br>
The spring beneath the tree;<br>
And thus the dear old Man replied,<br>
The grey-haired man of glee:        <br>
                  <br>
"No check, no stay, this Streamlet fears;<br>
How merrily it goes!<br>
'Twill murmur on a thousand years,<br>
And flow as now it flows.<br><br>

"And here, on this delightful day,                    <br>
I cannot choose but think<br>
How oft, a vigorous man, I lay<br>
Beside this fountain's brink.<br><br>

"My eyes are dim with childish tears,<br>
My heart is idly stirred,                             <br>
For the same sound is in my ears<br>
Which in those days I heard.<br><br>

"Thus fares it still in our decay:<br>
And yet the wiser mind<br>
Mourns less for what age takes away                   <br>
Than what it leaves behind.<br><br>

"The blackbird amid leafy trees,<br>
The lark above the hill,<br>
Let loose their carols when they please,<br>
Are quiet when they will. <br><br>

"With Nature never do <i>they</i> wage<br>
A foolish strife; they see<br>
A happy youth, and their old age<br>
Is beautiful and free:<br><br>

"But we are pressed by heavy laws;                    <br>
And often, glad no more,<br>
We wear a face of joy, because<br>
We have been glad of yore.<br><br>

"If there be one who need bemoan<br>
His kindred laid in earth,                            <br>
The household hearts that were his own;<br>
It is the man of mirth.<br><br>

"My days, my Friend, are almost gone,<br>
My life has been approved,<br>
And many love me; but by none                         <br>
Am I enough beloved."<br><br>

"Now both himself and me he wrongs,<br>
The man who thus complains!<br>
I live and sing my idle songs<br>
Upon these happy plains;<br><br>

"And, Matthew, for thy children dead<br>
I'll be a son to thee!"<br>
At this he grasped my hand, and said,<br>
"Alas! that cannot be."<br><br>

We rose up from the fountain-side;                    <br>
And down the smooth descent<br>
Of the green sheep-track did we glide;<br>
And through the wood we went;<br><br>

And, ere we came to Leonard's rock,<br>
He sang those witty rhymes                            <br>
About the crazy old church-clock,<br>
And the bewildered chimes.<br>

Roses, lilies, side by side,<br>

Neighbours in mortality.<br>
And, should I live through sun and rain<br>
Seven widowed years without my Jane,                   <br>
O Sexton, do not then remove her,<br>
Let one grave hold the Loved and Lover!<br>

<h2><a name="section23"></a>Lucy Gray; or, Solitude</h2>

<h4>Composed 1799.&mdash;Published 1800</h4>

<a href="#section23a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[Written at Goslar, in Germany, in 1799. It was founded on a
circumstance told me by my sister, of a little girl, who, not far from
Halifax in Yorkshire, was bewildered in a snow storm. Her footsteps were
tracked by her parents to the middle of a lock of a canal, and no other
vestige of her, backward or forward, could be traced. The body, however,
was found in the canal. The way in which the incident was treated, and
the spiritualizing of the character, might furnish hints for contrasting
the imaginative influences, which I have endeavoured to throw over
common life, with Crabbe's matter-of-fact style of handling subjects of
the same kind. This is not spoken to his disparagement, far from it; but
to direct the attention of thoughtful readers into whose hands these
notes may fall, to a comparison that may enlarge the circle of their
sensibilities, and tend to produce in them a catholic judgment.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>

<td>Oft I had heard of Lucy Gray:<br>
And, when I crossed the wild,<br>
I chanced to see at break of day<br>
The solitary child.<br><br>

No mate, no comrade Lucy knew;                       <br>
She dwelt on a wide moor,<br>
&mdash;The sweetest thing that ever grew<br>
Beside a human door!<br><br>

You yet may spy the fawn at play,<br>
The hare upon the green;                            <br>
But the sweet face of Lucy Gray<br>
Will never more be seen.<br><br>

"To-night will be a stormy night&mdash;<br>
You to the town must go;<br>
And take a lantern, Child, to light                 <br>
Your mother through the snow."<br><br>

"That, Father! will I gladly do:<br>
'Tis scarcely afternoon&mdash;<br>
The minster-clock has just struck two,<br>
And yonder is the moon!" <br><br>

At this the Father raised his hook,<br>
And snapped a faggot-band;<br>
He plied his work;&mdash;and Lucy took<br>
The lantern in her hand.<br><br>

Not blither is the mountain roe:                    <br>
With many a wanton stroke<br>
Her feet disperse the powdery snow,<br>
That rises up like smoke.<br><br>

The storm came on before its time:<br>
She wandered up and down;                           <br>
And many a hill did Lucy climb<br>
But never reached the town.<br><br>

The wretched parents all that night<br>
Went shouting far and wide;<br>
But there was neither sound nor sight               <br>
To serve them for a guide.<br><br>

At day-break on a hill they stood<br>
That overlooked the moor;<br>
And thence they saw the bridge of wood,<br>
A furlong from their door.<br><br>

They wept&mdash;and, turning homeward, cried,<br>
"In heaven we all shall meet;"<br>
&mdash;When in the snow the mother spied<br>
The print of Lucy's feet.<br><br>

Then downwards from the steep hill's edge       <br>
They tracked the footmarks small;<br>
And through the broken hawthorn hedge,<br>
And by the long stone-wall;<br><br>

And then an open field they crossed:<br>
The marks were still the same;                      <br>
They tracked them on, nor ever lost;<br>
And to the bridge they came.<br><br>

They followed from the snowy bank<br>
Those footmarks, one by one,<br>
Into the middle of the plank;                       <br>
And further there were none!<br><br>

&mdash;Yet some maintain that to this day<br>
She is a living child;<br>
That you may see sweet Lucy Gray<br>
Upon the lonesome wild.<br><br>

O'er rough and smooth she trips along,<br>
And never looks behind;<br>
And sings a solitary song<br>
That whistles in the wind.<br>

<a name="23n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">This poem was illustrated by Sir George Beaumont, in a picture of some
merit, which was engraved by J. C. Bromley, and published in the
collected editions of 1815 and 1820. Henry Crabb Robinson wrote in his
<i>Diary</i>, September 11, 1816 (referring to Wordsworth):</span>

 <blockquote> "He mentioned the origin of some poems. <i>Lucy Gray</i>, that tender
  and pathetic narrative of a child lost on a common, was occasioned by
  the death of a child who fell into the lock of a canal. His object was
  to exhibit poetically entire <i>solitude</i>, and he represents the
  child as observing the day-moon, which no town or village girl would
  ever notice." </blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">A contributor to <i>Notes and Queries</i>, May 12, 1883, whose signature
is F., writes:</span>

  <blockquote>"<b>The Scene of <i>Lucy Gray</i></b>.&mdash;In one of the editions of
  Wordsworth's works the scene of this ballad is said to have been near
  Halifax, in Yorkshire. I do not think the poet was acquainted with the
  locality beyond a sight of the country in travelling through on some
  journey. I know of no spot where all the little incidents mentioned in
  the poem would exactly fit in, and a few of the local allusions are
  evidently by a stranger. There is no 'minster'; the church at Halifax
  from time immemorial has always been known as the 'parish church,' and
  sometimes as the 'old church,' but has never been styled 'the
  minster.' The 'mountain roe,' which of course may be brought in as
  poetically illustrative, has not been seen on these hills for
  generations, and I scarcely think even the 'fawn at play' for more
  than a hundred years. These misapplications, it is almost unnecessary
  to say, do not detract from the beauty of the poetry. Some of the
  touches are graphically true to the neighbourhood, as, for instance,
  'the wide moor,' the 'many a hill,' the 'steep hill's edge,' the 'long
  stone wall,' and the hint of the general loneliness of the region
  where Lucy 'no mate, no comrade, knew.' I think I can point out the
  exact spot&mdash;no longer a 'plank,' but a broad, safe bridge&mdash;where Lucy
  fell into the water. Taking a common-sense view, that she would not be
  sent many miles at two o'clock on a winter afternoon to the town
  (Halifax, of course), over so lonely a mountain moor&mdash;bearing in mind
  also that this moor overlooked the river, and that the river was deep
  and strong enough to carry the child down the current&mdash;I know only one
  place where such an accident could have occurred. The clue is in this
  verse:

    <blockquote>'At day-break on a hill they stood<br>
    That overlooked the moor;<br>
    And thence they saw the bridge of wood,<br>
    A furlong from their door.'</blockquote>

  The hill I take to be the high ridge of Greetland and Norland Moor,
  and the plank she had to cross Sterne Mill Bridge, which there spans
  the Calder, broad and rapid enough at any season to drown either a
  young girl or a grown-up person. The mountain burns, romantic and wild
  though they be, are not dangerous to cross, especially for a child old
  enough to go and seek her mother. To sum up the matter, the hill
  overlooking the moor, the path to and distance from the town, the
  bridge, the current, all indicate one point, and one point only, where
  this accident could have happened, and that is the bridge near Sterne
  Mill. This bridge is so designated from the Sterne family, a branch of
  whom in the last century resided close by. The author of <i>Tristram
  Shandy</i> spent his boyhood here; and Lucy Gray, had she safely
  crossed the plank, would immediately have passed Wood Hall, where the
  boy Laurence had lived, and, pursuing her way to Halifax, would have
  gone through the meadows in which stood Heath School, where young
  Sterne had been educated. The mill-weir at Sterne Mill Bridge was, I
  believe, the scene of Lucy Gray's death."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Sterne Mill Bridge, however, crosses the river Calder, while Wordsworth
tells us that the girl lost her life by falling "into the lock of a
canal." The Calder runs parallel with the canal near Sterne Mill Bridge.

<td>When Ruth was left half desolate,                      <br>
Her Father took another Mate;<br>
And Ruth, not seven years old,<br>
A slighted child, at her own will<br>
Went wandering over dale and hill,                     <br>
In thoughtless freedom, bold.<br><br>

And she had made a pipe of straw,<br>
And music from that pipe could draw<br>
Like sounds of winds and floods;<br>
Had built a bower upon the green,                     <br>
As if she from her birth had been<br>
An infant of the woods.<br><br>

Beneath her father's roof, alone<br>
She seemed to live; her thoughts her own;<br>
Herself her own delight;                              <br>
Pleased with herself, nor sad, nor gay;<br>
And, passing thus the live-long day,<br>
She grew to woman's height.<br><br>

There came a Youth from Georgia's shore&mdash;<br>
A military casque he wore,                            <br>
With splendid feathers drest;<br>
He brought them from the Cherokees;<br>
The feathers nodded in the breeze,<br>
And made a gallant crest.<br><br>

From Indian blood you deem him sprung:                <br>
But no! he spake the English tongue,<br>
And bore a soldier's name;<br>
And, when America was free<br>
From battle and from jeopardy,<br>
He 'cross the ocean came. <br><br>

With hues of genius on his cheek<br>
In finest tones the Youth could speak:<br>
&mdash;While he was yet a boy,<br>
The moon, the glory of the sun,<br>
And streams that murmur as they run,                  <br>
Had been his dearest joy.<br><br>

He was a lovely Youth! I guess<br>
The panther in the wilderness<br>
Was not so fair as he;<br>
And, when he chose to sport and play,                 <br>
No dolphin ever was so gay<br>
Upon the tropic sea.<br><br>

Among the Indians he had fought,<br>
And with him many tales he brought<br>
Of pleasure and of fear;                              <br>
Such tales as told to any maid<br>
By such a Youth, in the green shade,<br>
Were perilous to hear.<br><br>

He told of girls&mdash;a happy rout!<br>
Who quit their fold with dance and shout,             <br>
Their pleasant Indian town,<br>
To gather strawberries all day long;<br>
Returning with a choral song<br>
When daylight is gone down.<br><br>

He spake of plants that hourly change                 <br>
Their blossoms, through a boundless range<br>
Of intermingling hues;<br>
With budding, fading, faded flowers<br>
They stand the wonder of the bowers<br>
From morn to evening dews,<br>
<br>
He told of the magnolia, spread<br>
High as a cloud, high over head!<br>
The cypress and her spire;<br>
&mdash;Of flowers that with one scarlet gleam<br>
Cover a hundred leagues, and seem                     <br>
To set the hills on fire.<br><br>

The Youth of green savannahs spake,<br>
And many an endless, endless lake,<br>
With all its fairy crowds<br>
Of islands, that together lie                         <br>
As quietly as spots of sky<br>
Among the evening clouds.<br><br>

"How pleasant," then he said, "it were<br>
A fisher or a hunter there,<br>
In sunshine or in shade                               <br>
To wander with an easy mind;<br>
And build a household fire, and find<br>
A home in every glade!<br><br>

"What days and what bright years! Ah me!<br>
Our life were life indeed, with thee                  <br>
So passed in quiet bliss,<br>
And all the while," said he, "to know<br>
That we were in a world of woe,<br>
On such an earth as this!"<br><br>

And then he sometimes interwove                       <br>
Fond thoughts about a father's love:<br>
"For there," said he, "are spun<br>
Around the heart such tender ties,<br>
That our own children to our eyes<br>
Are dearer than the sun.<br><br>

"Sweet Ruth! and could you go with me<br>
My helpmate in the woods to be,<br>
Our shed at night to rear;<br>
Or run, my own adopted bride,<br>
A sylvan huntress at my side,                         <br>
And drive the flying deer!<br><br>

"Belov&egrave;d Ruth!"&mdash;No more he said.<br>
The wakeful Ruth at midnight shed<br>
A solitary tear:<br>
She thought again&mdash;and did agree                     <br>
With him to sail across the sea,<br>
And drive the flying deer.<br><br>

"And now, as fitting is and right,<br>
We in the church our faith will plight,<br>
A husband and a wife."                               <br>
Even so they did; and I may say<br>
That to sweet Ruth that happy day<br>
Was more than human life.<br><br>

Through dream and vision did she sink,<br>
Delighted all the while to think                     <br>
That on those lonesome floods,<br>
And green savannahs, she should share<br>
His board with lawful joy, and bear<br>
His name in the wild woods.<br><br>

But, as you have before been told,                   <br>
This Stripling, sportive, gay, and bold,<br>
And, with his dancing crest,<br>
So beautiful, through savage lands<br>
Had roamed about, with vagrant bands<br>
Of Indians in the West.<br><br>

The wind, the tempest roaring high,<br>
The tumult of a tropic sky,<br>
Might well be dangerous food<br>
For him, a Youth to whom was given<br>
So much of earth&mdash;so much of heaven,                 <br>
And such impetuous blood.<br><br>

Whatever in those climes he found<br>
Irregular in sight or sound<br>
Did to his mind impart<br>
A kindred impulse, seemed allied                     <br>
To his own powers, and justified<br>
The workings of his heart.<br><br>

Nor less, to feed voluptuous thought,<br>
The beauteous forms of nature wrought,<br>
Fair trees and gorgeous flowers;                <br>
The breezes their own languor lent;<br>
The stars had feelings, which they sent<br>
Into those favored bowers.<br><br>

Yet, in his worst pursuits, I ween<br>
That sometimes there did intervene              <br>
Pure hopes of high intent:<br>
For passions linked to forms so fair<br>
And stately, needs must have their share<br>
Of noble sentiment.<br><br>

But ill he lived, much evil saw,                <br>
With men to whom no better law<br>
Nor better life was known;<br>
Deliberately, and undeceived,<br>
Those wild men's vices he received,<br>
And gave them back his own.<br><br>

His genius and his moral frame<br>
Were thus impaired, and he became<br>
The slave of low desires:<br>
A Man who without self-control<br>
Would seek what the degraded soul                    <br>
Unworthily admires.<br><br>

And yet he with no feigned delight<br>
Had wooed the Maiden, day and night<br>
Had loved her, night and morn:<br>
What could he less than love a Maid                  <br>
Whose heart with so much nature played<br>
So kind and so forlorn!<br><br>

Sometimes, most earnestly, he said,<br>
"O Ruth! I have been worse than dead;<br>
False thoughts, thoughts bold and vain,              <br>
Encompassed me on every side<br>
When I, in confidence and pride,<br>
Had crossed the Atlantic main.<br><br>

"Before me shone a glorious world&mdash;<br>
Fresh as a banner bright, unfurled                   <br>
To music suddenly:<br>
I looked upon those hills and plains,<br>
And seemed as if let loose from chains,<br>
To live at liberty.<br>
<br>
"No more of this; for now, by thee,                  <br>
Dear Ruth! more happily set free<br>
With nobler zeal I burn;<br>
My soul from darkness is released,<br>
Like the whole sky when to the east<br>
The morning doth return."                            <br>
<br>
Full soon that better mind was gone;<br>
No hope, no wish remained, not one,&mdash;<br>
They stirred him now no more;<br>
New objects did new pleasure give,<br>
And once again he wished to live                     <br>
As lawless as before.<br><br>

Meanwhile, as thus with him it fared,<br>
They for the voyage were prepared,<br>
And went to the sea-shore,<br>
But, when they thither came, the Youth               <br>
Deserted his poor Bride, and Ruth<br>
Could never find him more.<br><br>

God help thee, Ruth!-Such pains she had,<br>
That she in half a year was mad,<br>
And in a prison housed;                              <br>
And there, with many a doleful song<br>
Made of wild words, her cup of wrong<br>
She fearfully caroused.<br><br>

Yet sometimes milder hours she knew,<br>
Nor wanted sun, nor rain, nor dew,                   <br>
Nor pastimes of the May;<br>
&mdash;They all were with her in her cell;<br>
And a clear brook with cheerful knell<br>
Did o'er the pebbles play.<br><br>

When Ruth three seasons thus had lain,               <br>
There came a respite to her pain;<br>
She from her prison fled;<br>
But of the Vagrant none took thought;<br>
And where it liked her best she sought<br>
Her shelter and her bread.<br><br>

Among the fields she breathed again:<br>
The master-current of her brain<br>
Ran permanent and free;<br>
And, coming to the Banks of Tone,<br>
There did she rest; and dwell alone<br>
Under the greenwood tree.<br><br>

The engines of her pain, the tools<br>
That shaped her sorrow, rocks and pools,<br>
And airs that gently stir<br>
The vernal leaves&mdash;she loved them still;             <br>
Nor ever taxed them with the ill<br>
Which had been done to her.<br><br>

A Barn her <i>winter</i> bed supplies;<br>
But, till the warmth of summer skies<br>
And summer days is gone,                             <br>
(And all do in this tale agree)<br>
She sleeps beneath the greenwood tree,<br>
And other home hath none.<br><br>

An innocent life, yet far astray!<br>
And Ruth will, long before her day,<br>
Be broken down and old:<br>
Sore aches she needs must have! but less<br>
Of mind, than body's wretchedness,<br>
From damp, and rain, and cold.<br><br>

If she is prest by want of food,                     <br>
She from her dwelling in the wood<br>
Repairs to a road-side;<br>
And there she begs at one steep place<br>
Where up and down with easy pace<br>
The horsemen-travellers ride.<br><br>

That oaten pipe of hers is mute,<br>
Or thrown away; but with a flute<br>
Her loneliness she cheers:<br>
This flute, made of a hemlock stalk,<br>
At evening in his homeward walk <br>
The Quantock woodman hears.<br><br>

I, too, have passed her on the hills<br>
Setting her little water-mills<br>
By spouts and fountains wild&mdash;<br>
Such small machinery as she turned                   <br>
Ere she had wept, ere she had mourned,<br>
A young and happy Child!<br><br>

Farewell! and when thy days are told,<br>
Ill-fated Ruth, in hallowed mould<br>
Thy corpse shall buried be,                          <br>
For thee a funeral bell shall ring,<br>
And all the congregation sing<br>
A Christian psalm for thee.<br>

  "O Ruth! I have been worse than dead:<br>
  False thoughts, thoughts bold and vain<br>
  Encompass'd me on every side<br>
  When I, in thoughtlessness and pride,<br>
  Had cross'd the Atlantic Main.<br>
  <br>
  Whatever in those Climes I found<br>
  Irregular in sight or sound<br>
  Did to my mind impart<br>
  A kindred impulse, seem'd allied<br>
  To my own powers, and justified<br>
  The workings of my heart.<br>
  <br>
  Nor less to feed unhallow'd thought<br>
  The beauteous forms of nature wrought,<br>
  Fair trees and lovely flowers;<br>
  The breezes their own languor lent;<br>
  The stars had feelings which they sent<br>
  Into those magic bowers.<br>
  <br>
  Yet, in my worst pursuits, I ween,<br>
  That often there did intervene<br>
  Pure hopes of high intent;<br>
  My passions, amid forms so fair<br>
  And stately, wanted not their share<br>
  Of noble sentiment.<br>
  <br>
  So was it then, and so is now:<br>
  For, Ruth! with thee I know not how<br>
  I feel my spirit burn<br>
  Even as the east when day comes forth;<br>
  And to the west, and south, and north,<br>
  The morning doth return.<br>
  <br>
  It is a purer better mind:<br>
  O Maiden innocent and kind<br>
  What sights I might have seen!<br>
  Even now upon my eyes they break!"<br>

  Of Lands where he had been.</td>

<h2><a name="section25"></a>1800</h2>

<span style="color: #555555;">Towards the close of December 1799, Wordsworth came to live at Dove
Cottage, Town-end, Grasmere. The poems written during the following year
(1800), are more particularly associated with that district of the
Lakes. Two of them were fragments of a canto of <i>The Recluse</i>, entitled
"Home at Grasmere," referring to his settlement at Dove Cottage. Others,
such as <i>Michael</i>, and <i>The Brothers</i>&mdash;classed by him afterwards among
the "Poems founded on the Affections,"&mdash;deal with incidents in the rural
life of the dalesmen of Westmoreland and Cumberland. Most of the "Poems
on the Naming of Places" were written during this year; and the "Places"
are all in the neighbourhood of Grasmere. To these were added several
"Pastoral Poems"&mdash;such as <i>The Idle Shepherd Boys; or, Dungeon-Ghyll
Force</i>&mdash;sundry "Poems of the Fancy," and one or two "Inscriptions." In
all, twenty-five poems were written in the year 1800; and, with the
exception of the two fragments of <i>The Recluse</i>, they were published
during the same year in the second volume of the second edition of
"Lyrical Ballads." It is impossible to fix the precise date of the
composition of the fragments of <i>The Recluse</i>; but, as they refer to the
settlement at Dove Cottage&mdash;where Wordsworth went to reside with his
sister, on the 21st of December 1799&mdash;they may fitly introduce the poems
belonging to the year 1800. They were first published in 1851 in the
<i>Memoirs of Wordsworth</i> (vol. i. pp. 157 and 155 respectively), by the
poet's nephew, the late Bishop of Lincoln. The entire canto of <i>The
Recluse</i>, entitled "Home at Grasmere," will be included in this edition.<br>
<br>
The first two poems which follow, as belonging to the year 1800, are
parts of <i>The Recluse</i>, viz. "On Nature's invitation do I come," (which
is ll. 71-97, and 110-125), and "Bleak season was it, turbulent and
bleak," (which is ll. 152-167). They are not reprinted from the
<i>Memoirs</i> of 1851, because the text there given was, in several
instances, inaccurately reproduced from the original MS., which has been
re-examined. They were printed here, in <i>The Recluse</i>(1888), and in my
<i>Life of Wordsworth</i> (vol. i. 1889).&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

Aye, think on that, my heart, and cease to stir;               <br>
Pause upon that, and let the breathing frame<br>

Oh, if such silence be not thanks to God<br>
For what hath been bestowed, then where, where then<br>
Shall gratitude find rest? Mine eyes did ne'er                 <br>

Dear valley, having in thy face a smile,<br>
Though peaceful, full of gladness. Thou art pleased,           <br>
Pleased with thy crags, and woody steeps, thy lake,<br>
Its one green island, and its winding shores,<br>
The multitude of little rocky hills,<br>
Thy church, and cottages of mountain-stone<br>
Clustered like stars some few, but single most,                <br>
And lurking dimly in their shy retreats,<br>
Or glancing at each other cheerful looks,<br>
Like separated stars with clouds between.<br>

<a name="26n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp;<span style="color: #555555;"> This Grasmere cottage is identified, much more than Rydal Mount, with
Wordsworth's "poetic prime." It had once been a public-house, bearing
the sign of the Dove and Olive Bough&mdash;and as such is referred to in
<i>The Waggoner</i>&mdash;from which circumstance it was for a long time, and
is now usually, called "Dove Cottage." A small two storied house, it is
described somewhat minutely&mdash;as it was in Wordsworth's time&mdash;by De
Quincey, in his <i>Recollections of the Lakes</i>, and by the late
Bishop of Lincoln, in the <i>Memoirs</i> of his <a name="fr26A">uncle.</a> </span>

  <blockquote>"The front of it
faces the lake; behind is a small plot of orchard and garden ground, in
which there is a spring and rocks; the enclosure shelves upwards towards
the woody sides of the mountains above it."<a href="#26A"><sup>A</sup></a> </blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The following is De
Quincey's description <a name="fr26B">of</a> it, as he saw it in the summer of 1807. </span>

<blockquote>"A white cottage, with two yew trees breaking the glare of its white
  walls" (these yews still stand on the eastern side of the cottage). "A
  little semi-vestibule between two doors prefaced the entrance into
  what might be considered the principal room of the cottage. It was an
  oblong square, not above eight and a half feet high, sixteen feet
  long, and twelve broad; wainscoted from floor to ceiling with dark
  polished oak, slightly embellished with carving. One window there
  was&mdash;a perfect and unpretending cottage window, with little diamond
  panes, embowered at almost every season of the year with roses; and,
  in the summer and autumn, with a profusion of jasmine, and other
  fragrant shrubs.... I was ushered up a little flight of stairs,
  fourteen in all, to a little drawing-room, or whatever the reader
  chooses to call it. Wordsworth himself has described the fireplace of
  this room as his

    <blockquote>'Half-kitchen and half-parlour fire.'</blockquote>

  It was not fully seven feet six inches high, and in other respects
  pretty nearly of the same dimensions as the rustic hall below. There
  was, however, in a small recess, a library of perhaps three hundred
  volumes, which seemed to consecrate the room as the poet's study and
  composing room, and such occasionally it was. But far oftener he both
  studied, as I found, and composed on the high road."<a href="#26B"><sup>B</sup></a></blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Other poems of later years refer, much more fully than the above, to
this cottage, and its orchard ground, where so many of Wordsworth's
lyrics were composed.<br>
<br>
The "orchard ground," which was for the most part in grass, sloped
upwards; but a considerable portion of the natural rock was exposed; and
on its face, some rough stone steps were cut by Wordsworth, helped by a
near neighbour of his&mdash;John Fisher&mdash;so as more conveniently to reach the
upper terrace, where the poet built for himself a small arbour. All this
garden and orchard ground is not much altered since 1800. The short
terrace walk is curved, with a sloping bank of grass above, shaded by
apple trees, hazel, holly, laburnum, laurel, and mountain ash. Below the
terrace is the well, which supplied the cottage in Wordsworth's time;
and there large leaved primroses still grow, doubtless the successors of
those planted by his own and his sister's hands. Above, and amongst the
rocks, are the daffodils, which they also brought to their
"garden-ground;" the Christmas roses, which they planted near the well,
were removed to the eastern side of the garden, where they flourished
luxuriantly in 1882; but have now, alas! disappeared. The box-wood
planted by the poet grows close to the cottage. The arbour is now gone;
but, in the place where it stood, a seat is erected. The hidden brook
still sings its under-song, as it used to do, "its quiet soul on all
bestowing," and the green linnet may doubtless be seen now, as it used
to be in 1803. The allusions to the garden ground at Dove Cottage, in
the poems which follow, will be noted as they occur.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

When hitherward we journeyed, side by side,<br>
Through burst of sunshine and through flying showers,<br>
Paced the long vales, how long they were, and yet<br>
How fast that length of way was left behind,                   <br>
Wensley's rich vale and Sedbergh's naked heights.<br>
The frosty wind, as if to make amends<br>

Or, like two birds, companions in mid-air,                    <br>
Parted and reunited by the blast.<br>
Stern was the face of nature; we rejoiced<br>
In that stern countenance; for our souls thence drew<br>
A feeling of their strength. The naked trees,<br>
The icy brooks, as on we passed, appeared                     <br>
To question us, "Whence come ye? To what end?"<br>

<a name="27n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">This poem refers to a winter journey on foot, which Wordsworth and his
sister took from Sockburn to Grasmere, by Wensleydale and Askrigg; and,
since he has left us an account of this journey, in a letter to
Coleridge, written a few days after their arrival at Grasmere&mdash;a letter
in which his characterisation of Nature is almost as happy as it is in
his best poems&mdash;some extracts from it may here be appended.</span>

<blockquote>  "We left Sockburn last Tuesday morning. We crossed the Tees by
  moonlight in the Sockburn fields, and after ten good miles riding came
  in sight of the Swale. It is there a beautiful river, with its green
  banks and flat holms scattered over with trees. Four miles further
  brought us to Richmond, with its huge ivied castle, its friarage
  steeple, its castle tower resembling a huge steeple.... We were now in
  Wensleydale, and D. and I set off side by side to foot it as far as
  Kendal.... We reached Askrigg, twelve miles, before six in the
  evening, having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard
  frozen roads.... Next morning the earth was thinly covered with snow,
  enough to make the road soft and prevent its being slippery. On
  leaving Askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall. It was a
  beautiful morning, with driving snow showers, which disappeared by
  fits, and unveiled the east, which was all one delicious pale orange
  colour. After walking through two small fields we came to a mill,
  which we passed, and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before
  us, with an area of grassy ground, and a stream dashing over various
  lamin&aelig; of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs; the bank
  and stream on our left, another woody bank on our right, and the flat
  meadow in front, from which, as at Buttermere, the stream had retired,
  as it were, to hide itself under the shade. As we walked up this
  delightful valley we were tempted to look back perpetually on the
  stream, which reflected the orange lights of the morning among the
  gloomy rocks, with a brightness varying with the agitation of the
  current. The steeple of Askrigg was between us and the east, at the
  bottom of the valley; it was not a quarter of a mile distant.... The
  two banks seemed to join before us with a facing of rock common to
  them both. When we reached this bottom the valley opened out again;
  two rocky banks on each side, which, hung with ivy and moss, and
  fringed luxuriantly with brushwood, ran directly parallel to each
  other, and then approaching with a gentle curve at their point of
  union, presented a lofty waterfall, the termination of the valley. It
  was a keen frosty morning, showers of snow threatening us, but the sun
  bright and active. We had a task of twenty-one miles to perform in a
  short winter's day.... On a nearer approach the waters seemed to fall
  down a tall arch or niche that had shaped itself by insensible
  moulderings in the wall of an old castle. We left this spot with
  reluctance, but highly exhilarated.... It was bitter cold, the wind
  driving the snow behind us in the best style of a mountain storm. We
  soon reached an inn at a place called Hardrane, and descending from
  our vehicles, after warming ourselves by the cottage fire, we walked
  up the brook-side to take a view of a third waterfall. We had not
  walked above a few hundred yards between two winding rocky banks
  before we came full upon the waterfall, which seemed to throw itself
  in a narrow line from a lofty wall of rock, the water, which shot
  manifestly to some distance from the rock, seeming to be dispersed
  into a thin shower scarcely visible before it reached the bason. We
  were disappointed in the cascade itself, though the introductory and
  accompanying banks were an exquisite mixture of grandeur and
  beauty.... After cautiously sounding our way over stones of all
  colours and sizes, encased in the clearest water formed by the spray
  of the fall, we found the rock, which before had appeared like a wall,
  extending itself over our heads, like the ceiling of a huge cave, from
  the summit of which the waters shot directly over our heads into a
  bason, and among fragments wrinkled over with masses of ice as white
  as snow, or rather, as Dorothy says, like congealed froth. The water
  fell at least ten yards from us, and we stood directly behind it, the
  excavation not so deep in the rock as to impress any feeling of
  darkness, but lofty and magnificent; but in connection with the
  adjoining banks excluding as much of the sky as could well be spared
  from a scene so exquisitely beautiful. The spot where we stood was as
  dry as the chamber in which I am now sitting, and the incumbent rock,
  of which the groundwork was limestone, veined and dappled with colours
  which melted into each other with every possible variety of colour. On
  the summit of the cave were three festoons, or rather wrinkles, in the
  rock, run up parallel like the folds of a curtain when it is drawn up.
  Each of these was hung with icicles of various length, and nearly in
  the middle of the festoon, in the deepest valley of the waves that ran
  parallel to each other, the stream shot from the rows of icicles in
  irregular fits of strength, and with a body of water that varied every
  moment. Sometimes the stream shot into the bason in one continued
  current; sometimes it was interrupted almost in the midst of its fall,
  and was blown towards part of the waterfall at no great distance from
  our feet like the heaviest thunder shower. In such a situation you
  have at every moment a feeling of the presence of the sky. Large
  fleecy clouds drove over our heads above the rush of the water, and
  the sky appeared of a blue more than usually brilliant. The rocks on
  each side, which, joining with the side of this cave, formed the vista
  of the brook, were chequered with three diminutive waterfalls, or
  rather courses of water. Each of these was a miniature of all that
  summer and winter can produce of delicate beauty. The rock in the
  centre of the falls, where the water was most abundant, a deep black,
  the adjoining parts yellow, white, purple, and dove colour, covered
  with water&mdash;plants of the most vivid green, and hung with streaming
  icicles, that in some places seem to conceal the verdure of the plants
  and the violet and yellow variegation of the rocks; and in some places
  render the colours more brilliant. I cannot express to you the
  enchanting effect produced by this Arabian scene of colour as the wind
  blew aside the great waterfall behind which we stood, and alternately
  hid and revealed each of these fairy cataracts in irregular
  succession, or displayed them with various gradations of distinctness
  as the intervening spray was thickened or dispersed. What a scene too
  in summer! In the luxury of our imagination we could not help feeding
  upon the pleasure which this cave, in the heat of a July noon, would
  spread through a frame exquisitely sensible. That huge rock on the
  right, the bank winding round on the left with all its living foliage,
  and the breeze stealing up the valley, and bedewing the cavern with
  the freshest imaginable spray. And then the murmur of the water, the
  quiet, the seclusion, and a long summer day."</blockquote>

<td>Fair Ellen Irwin, when she sate                         <br>
Upon the braes of Kirtle,<br>
Was lovely as a Grecian maid<br>
Adorned with wreaths of myrtle;<br>
Young Adam Bruce beside her lay,                      <br>
And there did they beguile the day<br>
With love and gentle speeches,<br>
Beneath the budding beeches.<br><br>

From many knights and many squires<br>
The Bruce had been selected;                         <br>
And Gordon, fairest of them all,<br>
By Ellen was rejected.<br>
Sad tidings to that noble Youth!<br>
For it may be proclaimed with truth,<br>
If Bruce hath loved sincerely,                       <br>
That Gordon loves as dearly.<br><br>

But what are Gordon's form and face,<br>
His shattered hopes and crosses,<br>
To them, 'mid Kirtle's pleasant braes,<br>
Reclined on flowers and mosses?                  <br>
Alas that ever he was born!<br>
The Gordon, couched behind a thorn,<br>
Sees them and their caressing;<br>
Beholds them blest and blessing.<br><br>

Proud Gordon, maddened by the thoughts           <br>
That through his brain are travelling,<br>
Rushed forth, and at the heart of Bruce<br>
He launched a deadly javelin!<br>
Fair Ellen saw it as it came,<br>
And, starting up to meet the same,               <br>
Did with her body cover<br>
The Youth, her chosen lover.<br><br>

And, falling into Bruce's arms,<br>
Thus died the beauteous Ellen,<br>
Thus, from the heart of her True-love,               <br>
The mortal spear repelling.<br>
And Bruce, as soon as he had slain<br>
The Gordon, sailed away to Spain;<br>
And fought with rage incessant<br>
Against the Moorish crescent.<br><br>

But many days, and many months,<br>
And many years ensuing,<br>
This wretched Knight did vainly seek<br>
The death that he was wooing.<br>
So, coming his last help to crave,                   <br>
Heart-broken, upon Ellen's grave<br>
His body he extended,<br>
And there his sorrow ended.<br><br>

Now ye, who willingly have heard<br>
The tale I have been telling,                        <br>
May in Kirkonnel churchyard view<br>
The grave of lovely Ellen:<br>
By Ellen's side the Bruce is laid;<br>
And, for the stone upon his head,<br>
May no rude hand deface it,                          <br>
And its forlorn Hic jacet.<br>

<a name="28n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">No Scottish ballad is superior in pathos to <i>Helen of Kirkconnell</i>.
It is based on a traditionary tale&mdash;the date of the event being
lost&mdash;but the locality, in the parish of Kirkpatrick-Fleming in
Dumfriesshire, is known; and there the graves of "Burd Helen" and her
lover are still pointed out.<br>
<br>
The following is Sir Walter Scott's account of the story:</span>

<blockquote>  "A lady of the name of Helen Irving, or Bell (for this is disputed by
  the two clans), daughter of the laird of Kirkconnell in Dumfriesshire,
  and celebrated for her beauty, was beloved by two gentlemen in the
  neighbourhood. The name of the favoured suitor was Adam Fleming of
  Kirkpatrick: that of the other has escaped tradition, although it has
  been alleged he was a Bell of Blackel-house. The addresses of the
  latter were, however, favoured by the friends of the lady, and the
  lovers were therefore obliged to meet in secret, and by night, in the
  Churchyard of Kirkconnell, a romantic spot, surrounded by the river
  Kirtle. During one of their private interviews, the jealous and
  despised lover suddenly appeared on the opposite bank of the stream,
  and levelled his carbine at the breast of his rival. Helen threw
  herself before her lover, received in her bosom the bullet, and died
  in his arms. A desperate and mortal combat ensued between Fleming and
  the murderer, in which the latter was cut to pieces."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">See <i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i>, vol. ii. p. 317.<br>
<br>
The original ballad&mdash;well known though it is&mdash;may be quoted as an
admirable illustration of the different types of poetic genius in
dealing with the same, or a kindred, theme.</span>

<blockquote>I wish I were where Helen lies!<br>
Night and day on me she cries;<br>
O that I were where Helen lies,<br>
  On fair Kirkconnell lee!<br><br>

Cursed be the heart that thought the thought,<br>
And curst the hand that fired the shot,<br>
When in my arms burd Helen dropt,<br>
  And died to succour me!<br><br>

Oh think ye na my heart was sair,<br>
When my love dropt down and spake nae mair!<br>
There did she swoon wi' meikle care,<br>
  On fair Kirkconnell lee.<br><br>

As I went down the water side,<br>
None but my foe to be my guide,<br>
None but my foe to be my guide,<br>
  On fair Kirkconnell lee&mdash;<br><br>

I lighted down, my sword did draw,<br>
I hacked him in pieces sma',<br>
I hacked him in pieces sma',<br>
  For her sake that died for me.<br><br>

Oh, Helen fair, beyond compare!<br>
I'll weave a garland of thy hair<br>
Shall bind my heart for evermair,<br>
  Until the day I dee!<br><br>

Oh that I were where Helen lies!<br>
Day and night on me she cries;<br>
Out of my bed she bids me rise,<br>
  Says, "Haste, and come to me!"<br><br>

O Helen fair! O Helen chaste!<br>
Were I with thee I would be blest,<br>
Where thou lies low and takes thy rest,<br>
  On fair Kirkconnell lee.<br><br>

I wish my grave were growing green,<br>
A winding sheet drawn o'er my e'en,<br>
And I in Helen's arms lying<br>
  On fair Kirkconnell lee.<br><br>

I wish I were where Helen lies!<br>
Night and day on me she cries,<br>
And I am weary of the skies,<br>
  For her sake that died for me!</blockquote>

<h2><a name="section29"></a>Hart-Leap Well</h2>

<h4>Composed 1800.&mdash;Published 1800</h4>

<a href="#section29a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
Hart-Leap Well is a small spring of water, about five miles from
Richmond in Yorkshire, and near the side of the road which leads from
Richmond to Askrigg. Its name is derived from a remarkable chace, the
memory of which is preserved by the monuments spoken of in the second
Part of the following Poem, which monuments do now exist as I have there
described them.&mdash;W. W. 1800.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[Written at Town-end, Grasmere. The first eight stanzas were composed
extempore one winter evening in the cottage, when, after having tired
myself with labouring at an awkward passage in <i>The Brothers</i>, I
started with a sudden impulse to this to get rid of the other, and
finished it in a day or two. My sister and I had passed the place a few
weeks before in our wild winter journey from Sockburn on the banks of
the Tees to Grasmere. A peasant whom we met near the spot told us the
story so far as concerned the name of the Well, and the Hart, and
pointed out the Stones. Both the stones and the well are objects that
may easily be missed. The tradition by this time may be extinct in the
neighbourhood. The man who related it to us was very old.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>

<td>The Knight had ridden down from Wensley Moor<br>
With the slow motion of a summer's cloud<br>
And now, as he approached a vassal's door,<br>
"Bring forth another horse!" he cried aloud.<br><br>

"Another horse!"&mdash;That shout the vassal heard                   <br>
And saddled his best Steed, a comely grey;<br>
Sir Walter mounted him; he was the third<br>
Which he had mounted on that glorious day.<br><br>

Joy sparkled in the prancing courser's eyes;<br>
The horse and horseman are a happy pair;                       <br>
But, though Sir Walter like a falcon flies,<br>
There is a doleful silence in the air.<br><br>

A rout this morning left Sir Walter's Hall,<br>
That as they galloped made the echoes roar;<br>
But horse and man are vanished, one and all;                   <br>
Such race, I think, was never seen before.<br><br>

Sir Walter, restless as a veering wind,<br>
Calls to the few tired dogs that yet remain:<br>
Blanch, Swift, and Music, noblest of their kind,<br>
Follow, and up the weary mountain strain.<br><br>

The Knight hallooed, he cheered and chid them on<br>
With suppliant gestures and upbraidings stern;<br>
But breath and eyesight fail; and, one by one,<br>
The dogs are stretched among the mountain fern.<br><br>

Where is the throng, the tumult of the race?<br>
The bugles that so joyfully were blown?<br>
&mdash;This chase it looks not like an earthly chase;<br>
Sir Walter and the Hart are left alone.<br><br>

The poor Hart toils along the mountain-side;<br>
I will not stop to tell how far he fled,                       <br>
Nor will I mention by what death he died;<br>
But now the Knight beholds him lying dead.<br><br>

Dismounting, then, he leaned against a thorn;<br>
He had no follower, dog, nor man, nor boy:<br>
He neither cracked his whip, nor blew his horn,            <br>
But gazed upon the spoil with silent joy.<br><br>

Close to the thorn on which Sir Walter leaned,<br>
Stood his dumb partner in this glorious feat;<br>
Weak as a lamb the hour that it is yeaned;<br>
And white with foam as if with cleaving sleet.<br><br>

Upon his side the Hart was lying stretched:<br>
His nostril touched a spring beneath a hill,<br>
And with the last deep groan his breath had fetched<br>
The waters of the spring were trembling still.<br><br>

And now, too happy for repose or rest,                         <br>
(Never had living man such joyful lot!)<br>
Sir Walter walked all round, north, south, and west,<br>
And gazed and gazed upon that darling spot.<br><br>

And climbing up the hill&mdash;(it was at least<br>
Four roods of sheer ascent) Sir Walter found              <br>
Three several hoof-marks which the hunted Beast<br>
Had left imprinted on the grassy ground.<br><br>

Sir Walter wiped his face, and cried, "Till now<br>
Such sight was never seen by human eyes:<br>
Three leaps have borne him from this lofty brow,               <br>
Down to the very fountain where he lies.<br><br>

"I'll build a pleasure-house upon this spot,<br>
And a small arbour, made for rural joy;<br>
'Twill be the traveller's shed, the pilgrim's cot,<br>
A place of love for damsels that are coy.<br><br>

"A cunning artist will I have to frame<br>
A basin for that fountain in the dell!<br>
And they who do make mention of the same,<br>
From this day forth, shall call it <b>Hart-Leap Well</b>.<br><br>

"And, gallant Stag! to make thy praises known,<br>
Another monument shall here be raised;<br>
Three several pillars, each a rough-hewn stone,<br>
And planted where thy hoofs the turf have grazed.<br><br>

"And, in the summer-time when days are long,<br>
I will come hither with my Paramour;                           <br>
And with the dancers and the minstrel's song<br>
We will make merry in that pleasant bower.<br><br>

"Till the foundations of the mountains fail<br>
My mansion with its arbour shall endure;&mdash;<br>
The joy of them who till the fields of Swale,                  <br>
And them who dwell among the woods of Ure!"<br><br>

Then home he went, and left the Hart, stone-dead,<br>
With breathless nostrils stretched above the spring.<br>
&mdash;Soon did the Knight perform what he had said;<br>
And far and wide the fame thereof did ring.<br><br>

Ere thrice the Moon into her port had steered,<br>
A cup of stone received the living well;<br>
Three pillars of rude stone Sir Walter reared,<br>
And built a house of pleasure in the dell.<br><br>

And near the fountain, flowers of stature tall                 <br>
With trailing plants and trees were intertwined,&mdash;<br>
Which soon composed a little sylvan hall,<br>
A leafy shelter from the sun and wind.<br><br>

And thither, when the summer days were long<br>
Sir Walter led his wondering Paramour;                    <br>
And with the dancers and the minstrel's song<br>
Made merriment within that pleasant bower.<br><br>

The Knight, Sir Walter, died in course of time,<br>
And his bones lie in his paternal vale.&mdash;<br>
But there is matter for a second rhyme,                        <br>
And I to this would add another tale.

<td>The moving accident is not my trade;<br>
To freeze the blood I have no ready arts:<br>
'Tis my delight, alone in summer shade,<br>
To pipe a simple song for thinking hearts.<br><br>

As I from Hawes to Richmond did repair,<br>
It chanced that I saw standing in a dell<br>
Three aspens at three corners of a square;<br>
And one, not four yards distant, near a well.<br><br>

What this imported I could ill divine:                          <br>
And, pulling now the rein my horse to stop,<br>
I saw three pillars standing in a line,&mdash;<br>
The last stone-pillar on a dark hill-top.<br><br>

The trees were grey, with neither arms nor head:<br>
Half wasted the square mound of tawny green;                    <br>
So that you just might say, as then I said,<br>
"Here in old time the hand of man hath been."<br><br>

I looked upon the hill both far and near,<br>
More doleful place did never eye survey;<br>
It seemed as if the spring-time came not here,                  <br>
And Nature here were willing to decay.<br><br>

I stood in various thoughts and fancies lost,<br>
When one, who was in shepherd's garb attired,<br>
Came up the hollow:&mdash;him did I accost,<br>
And what this place might be I then inquired. <br><br>

The Shepherd stopped, and that same story told<br>
Which in my former rhyme I have rehearsed.<br>
"A jolly place," said he, "in times of old!<br>
But something ails it now: the spot is curst.<br><br>

"You see these lifeless stumps of aspen wood&mdash;                  <br>
Some say that they are beeches, others elms&mdash;<br>
These were the bower; and here a mansion stood,<br>
The finest palace of a hundred realms!<br><br>

"The arbour does its own condition tell;<br>
You see the stones, the fountain, and the stream;               <br>
But as to the great Lodge! you might as well<br>
Hunt half a day for a forgotten dream.<br><br>

"There's neither dog nor heifer, horse nor sheep,<br>
Will wet his lips within that cup of stone;<br>
And oftentimes, when all are fast asleep,                       <br>
This water doth send forth a dolorous groan.<br><br>

"Some say that here a murder has been done,<br>
And blood cries out for blood: but, for my part,<br>
I've guessed, when I've been sitting in the sun,<br>
That it was all for that unhappy Hart.<br><br>

"What thoughts must through the creature's brain have past!<br>
Even from the topmost stone, upon the steep,<br>
Are but three bounds&mdash;and look, Sir, at this last&mdash;<br>
O Master! it has been a cruel leap.<br><br>

"For thirteen hours he ran a desperate race;                    <br>
And in my simple mind we cannot tell<br>
What cause the Hart might have to love this place,<br>
And come and make his death-bed near the well.<br><br>

"Here on the grass perhaps asleep he sank,<br>
Lulled by the fountain in the summer tide;                 <br>
This water was perhaps the first he drank<br>
When he had wandered from his mother's side.<br><br>

"In April here beneath the flowering thorn<br>
He heard the birds their morning carols sing;<br>
And he, perhaps, for aught we know, was born                    <br>
Not half a furlong from that self-same spring.<br><br>

"Now, here is neither grass nor pleasant shade;<br>
The sun on drearier hollow never shone;<br>
So will it be, as I have often said,<br>
Till trees, and stones, and fountain, all are gone."<br><br>

"Grey-headed Shepherd, thou hast spoken well;<br>
Small difference lies between thy creed and mine:<br>
This Beast not unobserved by Nature fell;<br>
His death was mourned by sympathy divine.<br><br>

"The Being, that is in the clouds and air,                      <br>
That is in the green leaves among the groves,<br>
Maintains a deep and reverential care<br>
For the unoffending creatures whom he loves.<br><br>

"The pleasure-house is dust:&mdash;behind, before,<br>
This is no common waste, no common gloom;                       <br>
But Nature, in due course of time, once more<br>
Shall here put on her beauty and her bloom.<br><br>

"She leaves these objects to a slow decay,<br>
That what we are, and have been, may be known;<br>
But at the coming of the milder day,                            <br>
These monuments shall all be overgrown.<br><br>

"One lesson, Shepherd, let us two divide,<br>
Taught both by what she shows, and what conceals;<br>
Never to blend our pleasure or our pride<br>
With sorrow of the meanest thing that feels."<br>

<a name="29n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">This poem was suggested to Wordsworth in December 1799 during the
journey with his sister from Sockburn in Yorkshire to Grasmere. I owe
the following local note on <i>Hart-Leap Well</i> to Mr. John R. Tutin
of Hull. </span>

  <blockquote>"June 20, 1881. Visited 'Hart-Leap Well,' the subject of Wordsworth's
  poem. It is situated on the road side leading from Richmond to
  Askrigg, at a distance of not more than three and a-half miles from
  Richmond, and not five miles as stated in the prefatory note to the
  poem. The 'three aspens at three corners of a square' are things of
  the past; also the 'three stone pillars standing in a line, on the
  hill above. In a straight line with the spring of water, and where the
  pillars would have been, a wall has been built; so that it is very
  probable the stone pillars were removed at the time of the building of
  this wall. The scenery around answers exactly to the description

    <blockquote>More doleful place did never eye survey;<br>
    It seemed as if the spring time came not here,<br>
    And Nature here were willing to decay.<br>
    ...<br>
    Now, here is neither grass nor pleasant shade.</blockquote>

  "It is barren moor for miles around. The water still falls into the
  'cup of stone,' which appeared to be of very long standing. Within ten
  yards of the well is a small tree, at the same side of the road as the
  well, on the right hand coming from Richmond."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The Rev. Thomas Hutchinson of Kimbolton wrote to me on June 18, 1883:</span>

<blockquote>  "The tree is not a Thorn, but a Lime. It is evidently an old one, but
  is now in full and beautiful leaf. It stands on the western side of
  the road, and a few yards distant from it. The well is somewhat nearer
  the road. This side of the road is open to the fell. On the other side
  the road is bounded by a stone wall: another wall meeting this one at
  right angles, exactly opposite the well. I ascended the hill on the
  north side of this wall for some distance, but could find no trace of
  any rough-hewn stone. Descending on the other side, I found in the
  wall one, and only one, such stone. I should say the base was in the
  wall. The stone itself leans outwards; so that, at the top, three of
  its square faces can be seen; and two, if not three, of these faces
  bear marks of being hammer-dressed. The distance from the stone to the
  well is about 40 yards, and the height of the stone out of the ground
  about 3 or 4 feet.<br>
<br>
  "The ascent from the well is a gentle one, not 'sheer'; nor does there
  appear to be any hollow by which the shepherd could ascend. On the
  western side of the road there is a wide plain, with a slight fall in
  that direction."<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left">
<br>
"<i>Hart-Leap Well</i> is the tale for me; in matter as good as this
  (<i>Peter Bell</i>); in manner infinitely before it, in my poor
  judgment."</blockquote>

<a href="#section30a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[Written at Town-end, Grasmere. I will only add a little monitory
anecdote concerning this subject. When Coleridge and Southey were
walking together upon the Fells, Southey observed that, if I wished to
be considered a faithful painter of rural manners, I ought not to have
said that my shepherd-boys trimmed their rustic hats as described in the
poem. Just as the words had passed his lips two boys appeared with the
very plant entwined round their hats. I have often wondered that
Southey, who rambled so much about the mountains, should have fallen
into this mistake, and I record it as a warning for others who, with far
less opportunity than my dear friend had of knowing what things are, and
far less sagacity, give way to presumptuous criticism, from which he was
free, though in this matter mistaken. In describing a tarn under
Helvellyn I say:</span>

<blockquote>"There sometimes doth a leaping fish<br>
  Send through the tarn a lonely cheer."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #663300;">This was branded by a critic of these days, in a review ascribed to Mrs.
Barbauld, as unnatural and absurd. I admire the genius of Mrs. Barbauld
and am certain that, had her education been favourable to imaginative
influences, no female of her day would have been more likely to
sympathise with that image, and to acknowledge the truth of the
sentiment.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>

<td>The valley rings with mirth and joy;                    <br>
Among the hills the echoes play<br>
A never never ending song,<br>
To welcome in the May.<br>
The magpie chatters with delight;                       <br>
The mountain raven's youngling brood<br>
Have left the mother and the nest;<br>
And they go rambling east and west<br>
In search of their own food;<br>
Or through the glittering vapours dart                 <br>
In very wantonness of heart.<br><br>

Beneath a rock, upon the grass,<br>
Two boys are sitting in the sun;<br>
Their work, if any work they have,<br>
Is out of mind&mdash;or done.<br>
On pipes of sycamore they play<br>
The fragments of a Christmas hymn;<br>
Or with that plant which in our dale<br>
We call stag-horn, or fox's tail,<br>
Their rusty hats they trim:                            <br>
And thus, as happy as the day,<br>
Those Shepherds wear the time away.<br><br>

Along the river's stony marge<br>
The sand-lark chants a joyous song;<br>
The thrush is busy in the wood,                        <br>
And carols loud and strong.<br>
A thousand lambs are on the rocks,<br>
All newly born! both earth and sky<br>
Keep jubilee, and more than all,<br>
Those boys with their green coronal;                   <br>
They never hear the cry,<br>
That plaintive cry! which up the hill<br>
Comes from the depth of Dungeon-Ghyll.<br><br>

Said Walter, leaping from the ground,<br>
"Down to the stump of yon old yew                      <br>
We'll for our whistles run a race."<br>
&mdash;Away the shepherds flew;<br>
They leapt&mdash;they ran&mdash;and when they came<br>
Right opposite to Dungeon-Ghyll,<br>
Seeing that he should lose the prize,                  <br>
"Stop!" to his comrade Walter cries&mdash;<br>
James stopped with no good will:<br>
Said Walter then, exulting; "Here<br>
You'll find a task for half a year.<br><br>

"Cross, if you dare, where I shall cross&mdash;             <br>
Come on, and tread where I shall tread."<br>
The other took him at his word,<br>
And followed as he led.<br>
It was a spot which you may see<br>
If ever you to Langdale go;                            <br>
Into a chasm a mighty block<br>
Hath fallen, and made a bridge of rock:<br>
The gulf is deep below;<br>
And, in a basin black and small,<br>
Receives a lofty waterfall.<br><br>

With staff in hand across the cleft<br>
The challenger pursued his march;<br>
And now, all eyes and feet, hath gained<br>
The middle of the arch.<br>
When list! he hears a piteous moan&mdash;                   <br>
Again!&mdash;his heart within him dies&mdash;<br>
His pulse is stopped, his breath is lost,<br>
He totters, pallid as a ghost,<br>
And, looking down, espies<br>
A lamb, that in the pool is pent                       <br>
Within that black and frightful rent.<br><br>

The lamb had slipped into the stream,<br>
And safe without a bruise or wound<br>
The cataract had borne him down<br>
Into the gulf profound.<br>
His dam had seen him when he fell,<br>
She saw him down the torrent borne;<br>
And, while with all a mother's love<br>
She from the lofty rocks above<br>
Sent forth a cry forlorn,                              <br>
The lamb, still swimming round and round,<br>
Made answer to that plaintive sound.<br><br>

When he had learnt what thing it was,<br>
That sent this rueful cry; I ween<br>
The Boy recovered heart, and told                      <br>
The sight which he had seen.<br>
Both gladly now deferred their task;<br>
Nor was there wanting other aid&mdash;<br>
A Poet, one who loves the brooks<br>
Far better than the sages' books,                      <br>
By chance had thither strayed;<br>
And there the helpless lamb he found<br>
By those huge rocks encompassed round.<br><br>

He drew it from the troubled pool,<br>
And brought it forth into the light:                   <br>
The Shepherds met him with his charge,<br>
An unexpected sight!<br>
Into their arms the lamb they took,<br>
Whose life and limbs the flood had spared;<br>
Then up the steep ascent they hied,                    <br>
And placed him at his mother's side;<br>
And gently did the Bard<br>
Those idle Shepherd-boys upbraid,<br>
And bade them better mind their trade.<br>

<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[Written at Town-end, Grasmere. Barbara Lewthwaite, now living at
Ambleside (1843), though much changed as to beauty, was one of two most
lovely sisters. Almost the first words my poor brother John said, when
he visited us for the first time at Grasmere, were, "Were those two
Angels that I have just seen?" and from his description, I have no doubt
they were those two sisters. The mother died in childbed; and one of our
neighbours at Grasmere told me that the loveliest sight she had ever
seen was that mother as she lay in her coffin with her babe in her arm.
I mention this to notice what I cannot but think a salutary custom once
universal in these vales. Every attendant on a funeral made it a duty to
look at the corpse in the coffin before the lid was closed, which was
never done (nor I believe is now) till a minute or two before the corpse
was removed. Barbara Lewthwaite was not in fact the child whom I had
seen and overheard as described in the poem. I chose the name for
reasons implied in the above; and here will add a caution against the
use of names of living persons. Within a few months after the
publication of this poem, I was much surprised, and more hurt, to find
it in a child's school book, which, having been compiled by Lindley
Murray, had come into use at Grasmere School where Barbara was a pupil;
and, alas! I had the mortification of hearing that she was very vain of
being thus distinguished; and, in after life she used to say that she
remembered the incident, and what I said to her upon the occasion.&mdash;I.

<td>The dew was falling fast, the stars began to blink;<br>
I heard a voice; it said, "Drink, pretty creature, drink!"<br>
And, looking o'er the hedge, before me I espied<br>
A snow-white mountain-lamb with a Maiden at its side.<br><br>

Nor sheep nor kine were near; the lamb was all alone,<br>
And by a slender cord was tethered to a stone;<br>
With one knee on the grass did the little Maiden kneel,<br>
While to that mountain-lamb she gave its evening meal.<br><br>

The lamb, while from her hand he thus his supper took,<br>
Seemed to feast with head and ears; and his tail with pleasure shook.<br>
"Drink, pretty creature, drink," she said in such a tone<br>
That I almost received her heart into my own.<br><br>

'Twas little Barbara Lewthwaite, a child of beauty rare!<br>
I watched them with delight, they were a lovely pair.<br>
Now with her empty can the Maiden turned away:<br>
But ere ten yards were gone her footsteps did she stay.<br><br>

Right towards the lamb she looked; and from a shady place<br>
I unobserved could see the workings of her face:<br>
If Nature to her tongue could measured numbers bring,<br>
Thus, thought I, to her lamb that little Maid might sing:<br><br>

"What ails thee, young One? what? Why pull so at thy cord?<br>
Is it not well with thee? well both for bed and board?<br>
Thy plot of grass is soft, and green as grass can be;<br>
Rest, little young One, rest; what is't that aileth thee?<br><br>

"What is it thou wouldst seek? What is wanting to thy heart?<br>
Thy limbs are they not strong? And beautiful thou art:<br>
This grass is tender grass; these flowers they have no peers;<br>
And that green corn all day is rustling in thy ears!<br><br>

"If the sun be shining hot, do but stretch thy woollen chain,<br>
This beech is standing by, its covert thou canst gain;<br>
For rain and mountain-storms! the like thou need'st not fear,<br>
The rain and storm are things that scarcely can come here.<br><br>

"Rest, little young One, rest; thou hast forgot the day<br>
When my father found thee first in places far away;<br>
Many flocks were on the hills, but thou wert owned by none,<br>
And thy mother from thy side for evermore was gone.<br><br>

"He took thee in his arms, and in pity brought thee home:<br>
A blessed day for thee! then whither wouldst thou roam?<br>
A faithful nurse thou hast; the dam that did thee yean<br>
Upon the mountain tops no kinder could have been.<br><br>

"Thou know'st that twice a day I have brought thee in this can<br>
Fresh water from the brook, as clear as ever ran;<br>
And twice in the day, when the ground is wet with dew<br>
I bring thee draughts of milk, warm milk it is and new.<br><br>

"Thy limbs will shortly be twice as stout as they are now,<br>
Then I'll yoke thee to my cart like a pony in the plough;<br>
My playmate thou shalt be; and when the wind is cold<br>
Our hearth shall be thy bed, our house shall be thy fold.<br><br>

"It will not, will not rest!&mdash;Poor creature, can it be<br>
That 'tis thy mother's heart which is working so in thee?<br>
Things that I know not of belike to thee are dear,<br>
And dreams of things which thou canst neither see nor hear.<br><br>

"Alas, the mountain-tops that look so green and fair!<br>
I've heard of fearful winds and darkness that come there;<br>
The little brooks that seem all pastime and all play,<br>
When they are angry, roar like lions for their prey.<br><br>

"Here thou need'st not dread the raven in the sky;<br>
Night and day thou art safe,&mdash;our cottage is hard by.<br>
Why bleat so after me? Why pull so at thy chain?<br>
Sleep&mdash;and at break of day I will come to thee again!"<br><br>

&mdash;As homeward through the lane I went with lazy feet,<br>
This song to myself did I oftentimes repeat;<br>
And it seemed, as I retraced the ballad line by line,<br>
That but half of it was hers, and one half of it was <i>mine</i>.<br><br>

Again, and once again, did I repeat the song;<br>
"Nay," said I, "more than half to the damsel must belong,<br>
For she looked with such a look, and she spake with such a tone,<br>
That I almost received her heart into my own."<br>

<h2><a name="section32"></a>The Farmer of Tilsbury Vale</h2>

<h4>Composed 1800.&mdash;Published 1815<a href="#32A"><sup>A</sup></a></h4>

<a href="#section32a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[The character of this man was described to me, and the incident upon
which the verses turn was told me, by Mr. Poole of Nether Stowey, with
whom I became acquainted through our common friend, S.T. Coleridge.
During my residence at Alfoxden, I used to see much of him, and had
frequent occasions to admire the course of his daily life, especially
his conduct to his labourers and poor neighbours; their virtues he
carefully encouraged, and weighed their faults in the scales of charity.
If I seem in these verses to have treated the weaknesses of the farmer
and his transgressions too tenderly, it may in part be ascribed to my
having received the story from one so averse to all harsh judgment.
After his death was found in his escritoir, a lock of grey hair
carefully preserved, with a notice that it had been cut from the head of
his faithful shepherd, who had served him for a length of years. I need
scarcely add that he felt for all men as his brothers. He was much
beloved by distinguished persons&mdash;Mr. Coleridge, Mr. Southey, Sir H.
Davy, and many others; and in his own neighbourhood was highly valued as
a magistrate, a man of business, and in every other social relation. The
latter part of the poem perhaps requires some apology, as being too much
of an echo to <i>The Reverie of Poor Susan</i>.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>

<td>'Tis not for the unfeeling, the falsely refined,<br>
The squeamish in taste, and the narrow of mind,<br>
And the small critic wielding his delicate pen,<br>
That I sing of old Adam, the pride of old men.<br><br>

He dwells in the centre of London's wide Town; <br>
His staff is a sceptre&mdash;his grey hairs a crown;<br>
And his bright eyes look brighter, set off by the streak<br>
Of the unfaded rose that still blooms on his cheek. <br><br>

'Mid the dews, in the sunshine of morn,&mdash;'mid the joy<br>
Of the fields, he collected that bloom, when a boy;<br>
That countenance there fashioned, which, spite of a stain<br>
That his life hath received, to the last will remain.<br><br>

A Farmer he was; and his house far and near<br>
Was the boast of the country for excellent cheer:<br>
How oft have I heard in sweet Tilsbury Vale<br>
Of the silver-rimmed horn whence he dealt his mild ale!<br><br>

Yet Adam was far as the farthest from ruin,<br>
His fields seemed to know what their Master was doing;<br>
And turnips, and corn-land, and meadow, and lea,<br>
All caught the infection&mdash;as generous as he.<br><br>

Yet Adam prized little the feast and the bowl,&mdash;<br>
The fields better suited the ease of his soul:<br>
He strayed through the fields like an indolent wight,<br>
The quiet of nature was Adam's delight.<br><br>

For Adam was simple in thought; and the poor,<br>
Familiar with him, made an inn of his door:<br>
He gave them the best that he had; or, to say<br>
What less may mislead you, they took it away.<br>
<br>
Thus thirty smooth years did he thrive on his farm:<br>
The Genius of plenty preserved him from harm: <br>
At length, what to most is a season of sorrow,<br>
His means are run out,&mdash;he must beg, or must borrow.<br><br>

To the neighbours he went,&mdash;all were free with their money;<br>
For his hive had so long been replenished with honey,<br>
That they dreamt not of dearth;&mdash;He continued his rounds,<br>
Knocked here-and knocked there, pounds still adding to pounds.<br><br>

He paid what he could with his ill-gotten pelf,<br>
And something, it might be, reserved for himself:<br>
Then (what is too true) without hinting a word,<br>
Turned his back on the country&mdash;and off like a bird.<br><br>

You lift up your eyes!&mdash;but I guess that you frame<br>
A judgment too harsh of the sin and the shame;<br>
In him it was scarcely a business of art,<br>
For this he did all in the <i>ease</i> of his heart.<br><br>

To London&mdash;a sad emigration I ween&mdash;<br>
With his grey hairs he went from the brook and the green;<br>
And there, with small wealth but his legs and his hands,<br>
As lonely he stood as a crow on the sands.<br><br>

All trades, as need was, did old Adam assume,&mdash;<br>
Served as stable-boy, errand-boy, porter, and groom;<br>
But nature is gracious, necessity kind,<br>
And, in spite of the shame that may lurk in his mind,<br>
<br>
He seems ten birthdays younger, is green and is stout;<br>
Twice as fast as before does his blood run about;<br>
You would say that each hair of his beard was alive,<br>
And his fingers are busy as bees in a hive.<br><br>

For he's not like an Old Man that leisurely goes<br>
About work that he knows, in a track that he knows;<br>
But often his mind is compelled to demur,<br>
And you guess that the more then his body must stir.<br><br>

In the throng of the town like a stranger is he,<br>
Like one whose own country's far over the sea;<br>
And Nature, while through the great city he hies,<br>
Full ten times a day takes his heart by surprise.<br><br>

This gives him the fancy of one that is young,<br>
More of soul in his face than of words on his tongue;<br>
Like a maiden of twenty he trembles and sighs,<br>
And tears of fifteen will come into his eyes.<br><br>

What's a tempest to him, or the dry parching heats?<br>
Yet he watches the clouds that pass over the streets;<br>
With a look of such earnestness often will stand,<br>
You might think he'd twelve reapers at work in the Strand.<br><br>

Where proud Covent-garden, in desolate hours<br>
Of snow and hoar-frost, spreads her fruits and her flowers,<br>
Old Adam will smile at the pains that have made<br>
Poor winter look fine in such strange masquerade.<br>
<br>
'Mid coaches and chariots, a waggon of straw,<br>
Like a magnet, the heart of old Adam can draw;<br>
With a thousand soft pictures his memory will teem,<br>
And his hearing is touched with the sounds of a dream.<br><br>

Up the Haymarket hill he oft whistles his way,<br>
Thrusts his hands in a waggon, and smells at the hay;<br>
He thinks of the fields he so often hath mown,<br>
And is happy as if the rich freight were his own.<br><br>

But chiefly to Smithfield he loves to repair,&mdash;<br>
If you pass by at morning, you'll meet with him there.<br>
The breath of the cows you may see him inhale,<br>
And his heart all the while is in Tilsbury Vale.<br><br>

Now farewell, old Adam! when low thou art laid,<br>
May one blade of grass spring over thy head;<br>
And I hope that thy grave, wheresoever it be,<br>
Will hear the wind sigh through the leaves of a tree.<br>

<i>Advertisement:</i><br>
<br>
By Persons resident in the country and attached to rural objects, many
places will be found unnamed or of unknown names, where little Incidents
will have occurred, or feelings been experienced, which will have given
to such places a private and peculiar interest. From a wish to give some
sort of record to such Incidents or renew the gratification of such
Feelings, Names have been given to Places by the Author and some of his
Friends, and the following Poems written in consequence<a href="#33A"><sup>A</sup></a>.&mdash;W. W. 1800.<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
<a name="33A"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote A:</span></a> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">It should be explained that owing to the chronological plan
adopted in this edition (see the preface to vol. i.), two of the poems
which were placed by Wordsworth in his series of "Poems on the Naming of
Places," but which belong to later years, are printed in subsequent
volumes.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<td>It was an April morning: fresh and clear<br>
The Rivulet, delighting in its strength,<br>
Ran with a young man's speed; and yet the voice<br>
Of waters which the winter had supplied<br>
Was softened down into a vernal tone.                       <br>
The spirit of enjoyment and desire,<br>
And hopes and wishes, from all living things<br>
Went circling, like a multitude of sounds.<br>
The budding groves seemed eager to urge on<br>
The steps of June; as if their various hues                 <br>
Were only hindrances that stood between<br>
Them and their object: but, meanwhile, prevailed<br>
Such an entire contentment in the air<br>
That every naked ash, and tardy tree<br>
Yet leafless, showed as if the countenance             <br>
With which it looked on this delightful day<br>
Were native to the summer.&mdash;Up the brook<br>
I roamed in the confusion of my heart,<br>
Alive to all things and forgetting all.<br>
At length I to a sudden turning came                       <br>
In this continuous glen, where down a rock<br>
The Stream, so ardent in its course before,<br>
Sent forth such sallies of glad sound, that all<br>
Which I till then had heard, appeared the voice<br>
Of common pleasure: beast and bird, the lamb,              <br>
The shepherd's dog, the linnet and the thrush<br>
Vied with this waterfall, and made a song,<br>
Which, while I listened, seemed like the wild growth<br>
Or like some natural produce of the air,<br>
That could not cease to be. Green leaves were here;        <br>
But 'twas the foliage of the rocks&mdash;the birch,<br>
The yew, the holly, and the bright green thorn,<br>
With hanging islands of resplendent furze:<br>
And, on a summit, distant a short space,<br>
By any who should look beyond the dell,                    <br>
A single mountain-cottage might be seen.<br>
I gazed and gazed, and to myself I said,<br>
"Our thoughts at least are ours; and this wild nook,<br>
My <b>Emma</b>, I will dedicate to thee."<br>
&mdash;Soon did the spot become my other home,                  <br>
My dwelling, and my out-of-doors abode.<br>
And, of the Shepherds who have seen me there,<br>
To whom I sometimes in our idle talk<br>
Have told this fancy, two or three, perhaps,<br>
Years after we are gone and in our graves,                 <br>
When they have cause to speak of this wild place,<br>
May call it by the name of <b>Emma's Dell</b>.<br>

<a name="34n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">The text of the "Poems on the Naming of Places" underwent comparatively
little alteration in successive editions. Both the changes in the first
poem were made in 1845. From the Fenwick note, it is evident that "the
Rivulet" was Easdale beck. But where was "Emma's Dell"? In the autumn of
1877, Dr. Cradock, the Principal of Brasenose College, Oxford, took me
to a place, of which he afterwards wrote, </span>

<blockquote>"I have a fancy for a spot just beyond Goody Bridge to the left, where
  the brook makes a curve, and returns to the road two hundred yards
  farther on. But I have not discovered a trace of authority in favour
  of the idea farther than that the wooded bend of the brook with the
  stepping stones across it, connected with a field-path recently
  stopped, was a very favourite haunt of Wordsworth's. At the upper part
  of this bend, near to the place where the brook returns to the road,
  is a deep pool at the foot of a rush of water. In this pool, a man
  named Wilson was drowned many years ago. He lived at a house on the
  hill called Score Crag, which, if my conjecture as to Emma's Dell is
  right, is the 'single mountain cottage' on a 'summit, distant a short
  space.' Wordsworth, happening to be walking at no great distance,
  heard a loud shriek. It was that of Mr. Wilson, the father, who had
  just discovered his son's body in the beck."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">In the "Reminiscences" of the poet, by the Hon. Mr. Justice Coleridge,
which were contributed to the <i>Memoirs of Wordsworth</i>, written by his
nephew (vol. ii. pp. 300-315), there is a record of a walk they took up
Easdale to this place, entering the field just at the spot which Dr.
Cradock supposes to be "Emma's Dell."</span>

<blockquote>"He turned aside at a little farm-house, and took us into a swelling
  field to look down on the tumbling stream which bounded it, and which
  we saw precipitated at a distance, in a broad white sheet, from the
  mountain." (This refers to Easdale Force.) "Then, as he mused for an
  instant, he said,

   <blockquote> 'I have often thought what a solemn thing it would be could we have
    brought to our mind at once all the scenes of distress and misery
    which any spot, however beautiful and calm before us, has been
    witness to since the beginning. That water break, with the glassy
    quiet pool beneath it, that looks so lovely, and presents no images
    to the mind but of peace&mdash;there, I remember, the only son of his
    father, a poor man who lived yonder, was drowned.'"</blockquote></blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">This walk and conversation took place in October 1836. If any one is
surprised that Wordsworth, supposing him to have been then looking into
the very dell on which he wrote the above poem in 1800, did not name it
to Mr. Coleridge, he must remember that he was not in the habit of
speaking of the places he had memorialised in verse, and that in 1836
his "Sister Emmeline" had for a year been a confirmed invalid at Rydal.
I have repeatedly followed Easdale beck all the way up from its junction
with the Rothay to the Tarn, and found no spot corresponding so closely
to the realistic detail of this poem as the one suggested by Dr.
Cradock. There are two places further up the dale where the "sallies of
glad sound" such as are referred to in the poem, are even more
distinctly audible; but they are not at "a sudden turning," as is the
spot above Goody Bridge. If one leaves the Easdale road at this bridge,
and keeps to the side of the beck for a few hundred yards, till he
reaches the turning, &mdash;especially if it be a bright April morning, such
as that described in the poem,&mdash;and remembers that this path by the
brook was a favourite resort of Wordsworth and his sister, the
probability of Dr. Cradock's suggestion will be apparent. Lady
Richardson, who knew the place, and appreciated the poem as thoroughly
as any of Wordsworth's friends, told me that she concurred in this
identification of the "dell."&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

the effect of the reverberation of voices in some parts of the mountains
is very striking. There is, in <i>The Excursion</i>, an allusion to the
bleat of a lamb thus re-echoed, and described without any exaggeration,

<td>Amid the smoke of cities did you pass<br>
The time of early youth; and there you learned,<br>
From years of quiet industry, to love<br>
The living Beings by your own fire-side,<br>
With such a strong devotion, that your heart                    <br>
Is slow to meet the sympathies of them<br>
Who look upon the hills with tenderness,<br>
And make dear friendships with the streams and groves.<br>
Yet we, who are transgressors in this kind,                    <br>
Dwelling retired in our simplicity                             <br>
Among the woods and fields, we love you well,<br>
Joanna! and I guess, since you have been<br>
So distant from us now for two long years,<br>
That you will gladly listen to discourse,<br>
However trivial, if you thence be taught                   <br>
That they, with whom you once were happy, talk<br>
Familiarly of you and of old times.<br><br>

  While I was seated, now some ten days past,<br>
Beneath those lofty firs, that overtop<br>
Their ancient neighbour, the old steeple-tower,                <br>
The Vicar from his gloomy house hard by<br>
Came forth to greet me; and when he had asked,<br>
"How fares Joanna, that wild-hearted Maid!<br>
And when will she return to us?" he paused;<br>
And, after short exchange of village news,                     <br>
He with grave looks demanded, for what cause,<br>
Reviving obsolete idolatry,<br>
I, like a Runic Priest, in characters<br>
Of formidable size had chiselled out<br>
Some uncouth name upon the native rock,                        <br>
Above the Rotha, by the forest-side.<br>
&mdash;Now, by those dear immunities of heart<br>
Engendered between malice and true love,<br>
I was not loth to be so catechised,<br>
And this was my reply:&mdash;"As it befel,                          <br>
One summer morning we had walked abroad<br>
At break of day, Joanna and myself.<br>
&mdash;'Twas that delightful season when the broom,<br>
Full-flowered, and visible on every steep,<br>
Along the copses runs in veins of gold.                        <br>
Our pathway led us on to Rotha's banks;<br>
And when we came in front of that tall rock<br>
That eastward looks, I there stopped short&mdash;and stood<br>
Tracing the lofty barrier with my eye<br>
From base to summit; such delight I found                      <br>
To note in shrub and tree, in stone and flower<br>
That intermixture of delicious hues,<br>
Along so vast a surface, all at once,<br>
In one impression, by connecting force<br>
Of their own beauty, imaged in the heart.                      <br>
&mdash;When I had gazed perhaps two minutes' space,<br>
Joanna, looking in my eyes, beheld<br>
That ravishment of mine, and laughed aloud.<br>
The Rock, like something starting from a sleep,<br>
Took up the Lady's voice, and laughed again;                   <br>
That ancient Woman seated on Helm-crag<br>
Was ready with her cavern; Hammar-scar,<br>
And the tall Steep of Silver-how, sent forth<br>
A noise of laughter; southern Loughrigg heard,<br>
And Fairfield answered with a mountain tone;                   <br>
Helvellyn far into the clear blue sky<br>
Carried the Lady's voice,&mdash;old Skiddaw blew<br>
His speaking-trumpet;&mdash;back out of the clouds<br>
Of Glaramara southward came the voice;<br>
And Kirkstone tossed it from his misty head.                   <br>
&mdash;Now whether (said I to our cordial Friend,<br>
Who in the hey-day of astonishment<br>
Smiled in my face) this were in simple truth<br>
A work accomplished by the brotherhood<br>
Of ancient mountains, or my ear was touched                    <br>
With dreams and visionary impulses<br>
To me alone imparted, sure I am<br>
That there was a loud uproar in the hills.<br>
And, while we both were listening, to my side<br>
The fair Joanna drew, as if she wished                         <br>
To shelter from some object of her fear.<br>
&mdash;And hence, long afterwards, when eighteen moons<br>
Were wasted, as I chanced to walk alone<br>
Beneath this rock, at sunrise, on a calm<br>
And silent morning, I sat down, and there,                     <br>
In memory of affections old and true,<br>
I chiselled out in those rude characters<br>
Joanna's name deep in the living stone:&mdash;<br>
And I, and all who dwell by my fireside,<br>
Have called the lovely rock, <b>Joanna's Rock</b>."                   <br>

<a name="35n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; In Cumberland and Westmoreland are several Inscriptions upon the native
rock which from the wasting of Time and the rudeness of the Workmanship
had been mistaken for Runic. They are without doubt Roman.<br>
<br>
The Rotha, mentioned in this poem, is the River which flowing through
the Lakes of Grasmere and Rydale falls into Wyndermere. On Helm-Crag,
that impressive single Mountain at the head of the Vale of Grasmere, is
a Rock which from most points of view bears a striking resemblance to an
Old Woman cowering. Close by this rock is one of those Fissures or
Caverns, which in the language of the Country are called Dungeons. The
other Mountains either immediately surround the Vale of Grasmere, or
belong to the same Cluster.&mdash;W. W. 1800.<br>
<br>
Most of the Mountains here mentioned immediately surround the vale of
Grasmere; of the others, some are at a considerable distance, but they
belong to the same cluster.&mdash; W. W. 1802.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">The majority of the changes introduced into the text of this poem were
made in the year 1836.<br>
<br>
The place where the echo of the bleat of the lamb was heard &mdash;referred
to in the Fenwick note&mdash;may be easily found. The "precipice" is Pavy
Ark. "The 'lofty firs, that overtop their ancient neighbour, the old
steeple-tower,' stood by the roadside, scarcely twenty yards north-west
from the steeple of Grasmere church. Their site is now included in the
road, which has been widened at that point. They were Scotch firs of
unusual size, and might justly be said to 'overtop their neighbour' the
tower. Mr. Fleming Green, who well remembers the trees, gave me this
information, which is confirmed by other inhabitants. </span>

<blockquote>"When the road was enlarged, not many years ago, the roots of the
  trees were found by the workmen." </blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">(Dr. Cradock to the editor.) The</span>

<blockquote>'tall rock<br>
    That eastward looks'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">by the banks of the Rotha, presenting a "lofty barrier" "from base to
summit," is manifestly a portion of Helmcrag. It is impossible to know
whether Wordsworth carved Joanna Hutchinson's name anywhere on Helmcrag,
and it is useless to enquire. If he did so, the discovery of the place
would not help any one to understand or appreciate the poem. It is
obvious that he did not intend to be literally exact in details, as the
poem was written in 1800, and addressed to Joanna Hutchinson,&mdash;who is
spoken of as having been absent from Grasmere "for two long years;" and
Wordsworth says that he carved the Runic characters <i>in memoriam</i>
eighteen months after that summer morning when he heard the echo of her
laugh. But the family took up residence at Grasmere only in December
1799, and the "Poems on the Naming of Places" were published before the
close of 1800. The effect of these lines to Joanna, however, is
certainly not impaired&mdash;it may even be enhanced&mdash;by our inability to
localise them. Only one in the list of places referred to can occasion
any perplexity, <i>viz.</i>, Hammar-scar, since it is a name now disused in the
district. It used to be applied to some rocks on the flank of
Silver-how, to the wood around them, and also to the gorge between
Silver-how and Loughrigg. Hammar, from the old Norse <i>hamar</i>, signifies
a steep broken rock.<br>
<br>
The imaginative description of the echo of the lady's laugh suggests a
parallel passage from Michael Drayton's <i>Polyolbion</i>, which Wordsworth
must doubtless have read. (See his sister's reference to Drayton in her
<i>Recollections of a Tour made in Scotland</i>, in 1803: in the <a href="#109n1">note</a> to the
poem, <i>At the grave of Burns</i>, p. 382 of this volume.)</span>

<blockquote>Which <i>Copland</i> scarce had spoke, but quickly every Hill<br>
Upon her verge that stands, the neighbouring valleys fill;<br>
<i>Helvillon</i> from his height, it through the mountains threw,<br>
From whence as soon again, the sound <i>Dunbalrase</i> drew,<br>
From whose stone-troph&egrave;d head, it on the <i>Wendrosse</i> went,<br>
Which tow'rds the sea again, resounded it to <i>Dent</i>,<br>
That <i>Brodwater</i> therewith within her banks astound,<br>
In sailing to the sea, told it to <i>Egremound</i>,<br>
Whose buildings, walks, and streets, with echoes loud and long,<br>
Did mightily commend old <i>Copland</i> for her song.</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;"><i>Polyolbion</i>, The Thirtieth Song, ll. 155-164.


Any one who compares this passage with Wordsworth's <i>Joanna</i> will see
the difference between the elaborate fancy of a topographical narrator,
and the vivid imagination of a poetical idealist. A somewhat similar
instance of indebtedness&mdash;in which the debt is repaid by additional
insight&mdash;is seen when we compare a passage from Sir John Davies's
<i>Orchestra, or a poem on Dancing</i> (stanza 49), with one from <i>The
Ancient Mariner</i>, Part VI. stanzas 2 and 3&mdash;although there was more of
the true imaginative light in Davies than in Drayton.</span>

<blockquote>For lo, the sea that fleets about the land,<br>
  And like a girdle clips her solid waist,<br>
Music and measure both doth understand;<br>
  For his great crystal eye is always cast<br>
  Up to the moon, and on her fixed fast:<br>
    And as she danceth in her palid sphere<br>
    So danceth he about his centre here.  </blockquote>

<b>Davies</b>.<br>


<blockquote>Still as a slave before his lord,<br>
    The ocean hath no blast;<br>
    His great bright eye most silently<br>
    Up to the moon is cast&mdash;<br><br>

    If he may know which way to go;<br>
    For she guides him smooth or grim.<br>
    See, brother, see! how graciously<br>
    She looketh down on him.</blockquote>

<b>Coleridge</b>.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">These extracts show how both Wordsworth and Coleridge assimilated past
literary products, and how they glorified them by reproduction. There
was little, however, in the poetic imagery of previous centuries that
Wordsworth reproduced. His imagination worked in a sphere of its own,
free from the trammels of precedent; and he was more original than any
other nineteenth century poet in his use of symbol and metaphor. The
poem <i>To Joanna</i> was probably composed on August 22, 1800, as the
following occurs in Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Journal</i> under that date:</span>

 <blockquote> "William was composing all the morning ... W. read us the poem of
  Joanna, beside the Rothay, by the roadside."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Charles Lamb wrote to Wordsworth in January 1801, of</span>

 <blockquote> "these continuous echoes in the story of 'Joanna's laugh,' when the
  mountains and all the scenery seem absolutely alive."</blockquote>

<td>A narrow girdle of rough stones and crags,<br>
A rude and natural causeway, interposed<br>
Between the water and a winding slope<br>
Of copse and thicket, leaves the eastern shore<br>
Of Grasmere safe in its own privacy:                     <br>
And there myself and two belov&egrave;d Friends,<br>
One calm September morning, ere the mist<br>
Had altogether yielded to the sun,<br>
Sauntered on this retired and difficult way.<br>
&mdash;Ill suits the road with one in haste; but we              <br>
Played with our time; and, as we strolled along,<br>
It was our occupation to observe<br>
Such objects as the waves had tossed ashore&mdash;<br>
Feather, or leaf, or weed, or withered bough,<br>
Each on the other heaped, along the line                    <br>
Of the dry wreck. And, in our vacant mood,<br>
Not seldom did we stop to watch some tuft<br>
Of dandelion seed or thistle's beard,<br>
That skimmed the surface of the dead calm lake,<br>
Suddenly halting now&mdash;a lifeless stand!                     <br>
And starting off again with freak as sudden;<br>
In all its sportive wanderings, all the while,<br>
Making report of an invisible breeze<br>
That was its wings, its chariot, and its horse,<br>
Its playmate, rather say, its moving soul.              <br>
&mdash;And often, trifling with a privilege<br>
Alike indulged to all, we paused, one now,<br>
And now the other, to point out, perchance<br>
To pluck, some flower or water-weed, too fair<br>
Either to be divided from the place                         <br>
On which it grew, or to be left alone<br>
To its own beauty. Many such there are,<br>
Fair ferns and flowers, and chiefly that tall fern,<br>
So stately, of the queen Osmunda named;<br>
Plant lovelier, in its own retired abode                    <br>
On Grasmere's beach, than Naiad by the side<br>
Of Grecian brook, or Lady of the Mere,<br>
Sole-sitting by the shores of old romance.<br>
&mdash;So fared we that bright morning: from the fields,<br>
Meanwhile, a noise was heard, the busy mirth                <br>
Of reapers, men and women, boys and girls.<br>
Delighted much to listen to those sounds,<br>
And feeding thus our fancies, we advanced     <br>
Along the indented shore; when suddenly,<br>
Through a thin veil of glittering haze was seen           <br>
Before us, on a point of jutting land,<br>
The tall and upright figure of a Man<br>
Attired in peasant's garb, who stood alone,<br>
Angling beside the margin of the lake.<br>
"Improvident and reckless," we exclaimed,                   <br>
"The Man must be, who thus can lose a day<br>
Of the mid harvest, when the labourer's hire<br>
Is ample, and some little might be stored<br>
Wherewith to cheer him in the winter time."<br>
Thus talking of that Peasant, we approached                 <br>
Close to the spot where with his rod and line<br>
He stood alone; whereat he turned his head<br>
To greet us&mdash;and we saw a Man worn down<br>
By sickness, gaunt and lean, with sunken cheeks<br>
And wasted limbs, his legs so long and lean                 <br>
That for my single self I looked at them,<br>
Forgetful of the body they sustained.&mdash;<br>
Too weak to labour in the harvest field,<br>
The Man was using his best skill to gain<br>
A pittance from the dead unfeeling lake                     <br>
That knew not of his wants. I will not say<br>
What thoughts immediately were ours, nor how<br>
The happy idleness of that sweet morn,<br>
With all its lovely images, was changed<br>
To serious musing and to self-reproach.                     <br>
Nor did we fail to see within ourselves<br>
What need there is to be reserved in speech,<br>
And temper all our thoughts with charity.<br>
&mdash;Therefore, unwilling to forget that day,<br>
My Friend, Myself, and She who then received                <br>
The same admonishment, have called the place<br>
By a memorial name, uncouth indeed<br>
As e'er by mariner was given to bay<br>
Or foreland, on a new-discovered coast;<br>
And <b>Point Rash-Judgment</b> is the name it bears.               <br>

<a name="37n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">The text of this poem reached its final state in the edition of 1827.
The same is true of the poem which follows, <i>To M. H.</i>, with the
exception of a single change.<br>
<br>
In Wordsworth's early days at Grasmere, a wild woodland path of quiet
beauty led from Dove Cottage along the margin of the lake to the "Point"
referred to in this poem, leaving the eastern shore truly "safe in its
own privacy"&mdash;a "retired and difficult way"; the high-way road for
carriages being at that time over White Moss Common. The late Dr.
Arnold, of Rugby and Foxhowe, used to name the three roads from Rydal to
Grasmere thus: the highest, "Old Corruption"; the intermediate, "Bit by
bit Reform"; the lowest and most level, "Radical Reform." Wordsworth was
never quite reconciled to the radical reform effected on a road that
used to be so delightfully wild and picturesque. The spot which the
three friends rather infelicitously named "Point Rash-Judgment" is
easily identified; although, as Wordsworth remarks, the character of the
shore is changed by the public road being carried along its side. The
friends were quite aware that the "memorial name" they gave it was
"uncouth." In spite of its awkwardness, however, it will probably
survive; if not for Browning's reason</span>

<blockquote>The better the uncouther;<br>
Do roses stick like burrs?</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">at least because of the incident which gave rise to the poem.
The date of composition is fixed by Dorothy Wordsworth's
<i>Journal</i>, </span>

  <blockquote>"10th Oct. 1800, Wm. sat up after me, writing <i>Point
  Rash-Judgment.</i>"</blockquote>

<a name="38n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">To find the pool referred to in the Fenwick note, I have carefully
examined the course of Rydal beck, all the way up to the foot of the
Fell. There is a pool beyond the enclosures of the Hall property, about
five hundred feet above Rydal Mount, which partly corresponds to the
description in the poem, but there is no wood around it now; and the
trees which skirt its margin are birch, ash, oak, and hazel, but there
are no beeches. It is a short way below some fine specimens of ice-worn
rocks, which are to the right of the stream as you ascend it, and above
these rocks is a well-marked moraine. It is a deep crystal pool, and has
a "firm margin" of (artificially placed) stones. This may be the spot
described in the poem; or another, within the grounds of the Hall, may
be the place referred to. It is a sequestered nook, beside the third
waterfall as you ascend the beck&mdash;this third cascade being itself a
treble fall. Seen two or three days after rain, when the stream is full
enough to break over the whole face of the rock in showers of snowy
brightness, yet low enough to shew the rock behind its transparent veil,
it is specially beautiful. Trees change so much in eighty years that the
absence of "beeches" now would not make this site impossible. In a MS.
copy of the poem (of date Dec. 28, 1800), the last line is</span>

<blockquote>'With all its poplars, we have named from you.'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Of the circular pool beneath this fall it may be said, as Wordsworth
describes it, that</span>

<blockquote>'... both flocks and herds might drink<br>
  On its firm margin, even as from a well;'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">and a "small slip of lawn" might easily have existed there in his time.
We cannot, however, be confident as to the locality, and I add the
opinion of several, whose judgment may be deferred to. Dr. Cradock
writes:</span>


<blockquote>  "As to Mary Hutchinson's pool, I think that it was not on the beck
  anywhere, but some detached little pool, far up the hill, to the
  eastwards of the Hall, in 'the woods.' The description does not well
  suit any part of Rydal beck; and no spot thereon could long 'remain
  unknown,' as the brook was until lately much haunted by anglers."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">My difficulty as to a site "far up the hill" is, that it must have been
a pool of some size, if "both flocks and herds might drink" all round
it; and there is no stream, scarce even a rill that joins Rydal beck on
the right, all the way up from its junction with the Rothay. The late
Mr. Hull of Rydal Cottage, wrote:</span>

<blockquote>  "Although closely acquainted with every nook about Rydal Park, I have
  never been able to discover any spot corresponding to that described
  in Wordsworth's lines to M. H. It is possible, however, that the
  'small bed of water' may have been a temporary rain pool, such as
  sometimes lodges in the hollows on the mountain-slope after heavy
  rain."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Mr. F. M. Jones, the agent of the Rydal property, writes: </span>

<blockquote>  "I do not know of any pool of water in the Upper Rydal Park. There are
  some pools up the river, 'Mirror Pool' among them; but I hardly think
  there can ever have been 'beech-trees' growing near them."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">There are many difficulties, and the place cannot now be identified.
Wordsworth's own wish will doubtless be realised,</span>

<blockquote>'The travellers know it not, and 'twill remain<br>
  Unknown to them.' </blockquote>

accuracy. The Eglantine grew on the little brook that runs past two
cottages (close to the path under Nab Scar), which have been built since
the poet's time, and are marked Brockstone on the Ordnance Map.</span>

 <blockquote> "The plant itself of course has long disappeared: but in following up
  the rill through the copse, above the cottages, I found an unusually
  large Eglantine, growing by the side of the stream."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">(Dr Cradock to the editor, in 1877.) It still grows luxuriantly there.<br>
<br>
The following extract from Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Journal</i> illustrates both
this and the next poem:</span>

<blockquote>  "Friday, 23rd April 1802.&mdash;It being a beautiful morning, we set off at
  eleven o'clock, intending to stay out of doors all the morning. We
  went towards Rydal, under Nab Scar. The sun shone and we were lazy.
  Coleridge pitched upon several places to sit down upon; but we could
  not be all of one mind respecting sun and shade, so we pushed on to
  the foot of the Scar. It was very grand when we looked up, very stony;
  here and there a budding tree. William observed that the umbrella
  Yew-tree that breasts the wind had lost its character as a tree, and
  had become like solid wood. Coleridge and I pushed on before. We left
  William sitting on the stones, feasting with silence, and I sat down
  upon a rocky seat, a couch it might be, under the Bower of William's
  'Eglantine,' 'Andrew's Broom.' He was below us, and we could see him.
  He came to us, and repeated his Poems, while we sat beside him. We
  lingered long, looking into the vales; Ambleside Vale, with the
  copses, the village under the hill, and the green fields; Rydale, with
  a lake all alive and glittering, yet but little stirred by breezes;
  and our own dear Grasmere, making a little round lake of Nature's own,
  with never a house, never a green field, but the copses and the bare
  hills enclosing it, and the river flowing out of it. Above rose the
  Coniston Fells, in their own shape and colour, ... the sky, and the
  clouds, and a few wild creatures. Coleridge went to search for
  something new. We saw him climbing up towards a rock. He called us,
  and we found him in a bower,&mdash;the sweetest that was ever seen. The
  rock on one side is very high, and all covered with ivy, which hung
  loosely about, and bore bunches of brown berries. On the other side,
  it was higher than my head. We looked down on the Ambleside vale, that
  seemed to wind away from us, the village lying under the hill. The fir
  tree island was reflected beautifully.... About this bower there is
  mountain-ash, common ash, yew tree, ivy, holly, hawthorn, roses,
  flowers, and a carpet of moss. Above at the top of the rock there is
  another spot. It is scarce a bower, a little parlour, not enclosed by
  walls, but shaped out for a resting-place by the rocks, and the ground
  rising about it. It had a sweet moss carpet. We resolved to go and
  plant flowers, in both these places to-morrow."</blockquote>

beyond doubt, on the wooded part of Nab-Scar, through which the upper
path from Grasmere to Rydal passes. There is one huge block of stone
high above the path, which answers well to the description in the second
stanza. Crabb Robinson wrote in his <i>Diary</i> (Sept. 11, 1816):</span>

<td>'Tis said, that some have died for love:<br>
And here and there a church-yard grave is found<br>
In the cold north's unhallowed ground,<br>
Because the wretched man himself had slain,<br>
His love was such a grievous pain.<br>
And there is one whom I five years have known;<br>
He dwells alone<br>
Upon Helvellyn's side:<br>
He loved&mdash;the pretty Barbara died;<br>
And thus he makes his moan:<br>
Three years had Barbara in her grave been laid<br>
When thus his moan he made:<br><br>

"Oh, move, thou Cottage, from behind that oak!<br>
Or let the aged tree uprooted lie,<br>
That in some other way yon smoke<br>
May mount into the sky!<br>
The clouds pass on; they from the heavens depart:<br>
I look&mdash;the sky is empty space;<br>
I know not what I trace;<br>
But when I cease to look, my hand is on my heart.<br><br>

"O! what a weight is in these shades! Ye leaves,<br>
That murmur once so dear, when will it cease?<br>
Your sound my heart of rest bereaves,<br>
It robs my heart of peace. <br>
Thou Thrush, that singest loud&mdash;and loud and free,<br>
Into yon row of willows flit,<br>
Upon that alder sit;<br>
Or sing another song, or choose another tree.<br><br>

"Roll back, sweet Rill! back to thy mountain-bounds,<br>
And there for ever be thy waters chained!<br>
For thou dost haunt the air with sounds<br>
That cannot be sustained;<br>
If still beneath that pine-tree's ragged bough<br>
Headlong yon waterfall must come,<br>
Oh let it then be dumb!<br>
Be anything, sweet Rill, but that which thou art now.<br><br>

"Thou Eglantine, so bright with sunny showers,<br>
Proud as a rainbow spanning half the vale,<br>
Thou one fair shrub, oh! shed thy flowers,<br>
And stir not in the gale.<br>
For thus to see thee nodding in the air,<br>
To see thy arch thus stretch and bend,<br>
Thus rise and thus descend,&mdash;<br>
Disturbs me till the sight is more than I can bear."<br><br>

The Man who makes this feverish complaint<br>
Is one of giant stature, who could dance<br>
Equipped from head to foot in iron mail.<br>
Ah gentle Love! if ever thought was thine<br>
To store up kindred hours for me, thy face<br>
Turn from me, gentle Love! nor let me walk<br>
Within the sound of Emma's voice, nor know<br>
Such happiness as I have known to-day.<br>

without the first, the fifth, and the last, it would have been deemed an
exquisite fragment by those who object to the explanatory preamble, and
to the moralising sequel. The intermediate stanzas suggest Burns's</span>

<blockquote>'Ye banks and braes o' bonnie Doon,<br>
    How can ye bloom sae fresh and fair!<br>
  How can ye chant, ye little birds,<br>
    An' I sae weary, fu' o' care!'</blockquote>

 <span style="color: #555555;">and Browning's <i>May and Death</i>:</span>

<blockquote>'I wish that when you died last May,<br>
    Charles, there had died along with you<br>
  Three parts of spring's delightful things;<br>
    Ay, and, for me, the fourth part too.'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">This mood of mind Wordsworth appreciated as fully as the opposite, or
complementary one, which finds expression in the great <i>Ode, Intimations
of Immortality</i> (vol. viii.), l. 26.</span>

<blockquote>'No more shall grief of mine the season wrong,'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">and which Browning expresses in other verses of his lyric, and
repeatedly elsewhere. The allusion in the last stanza of this poem is to
Wordsworth's sister Dorothy.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

&mdash;Of coats and of jackets grey, scarlet, and green,<br>
On the slopes of the pastures all colours were seen;<br>
With their comely blue aprons, and caps white as snow,<br>
The girls on the hills made a holiday show.<br><br>

Fresh sprigs of green box-wood, not six months before,<br>
Filled the funeral basin at Timothy's door;<br>
A coffin through Timothy's threshold had past;<br>
One Child did it bear, and that Child was his last.<br><br>

Now fast up the dell came the noise and the fray,<br>
The horse and the horn, and the hark! hark away!<br>
Old Timothy took up his staff, and he shut<br>
With a leisurely motion the door of his hut.<br><br>

Perhaps to himself at that moment he said;<br>
"The key I must take, for my Ellen is dead."<br>
But of this in my ears not a word did he speak;<br>
And he went to the chase with a tear on his cheek.<br>

<td>These Tourists, heaven preserve us! needs must live<br>
A profitable life: some glance along,<br>
Rapid and gay, as if the earth were air,<br>
And they were butterflies to wheel about<br>
Long as the summer lasted: some, as wise,                   <br>
Perched on the forehead of a jutting crag,<br>
Pencil in hand and book upon the knee,<br>
Will look and scribble, scribble on and look,<br>
Until a man might travel twelve stout miles,<br>
Or reap an acre of his neighbour's corn.                       <br>
But, for that moping Son of Idleness,<br>
Why can he tarry <i>yonder</i>?&mdash;In our church-yard<br>
Is neither epitaph nor monument,<br>
Tombstone nor name&mdash;only the turf we tread<br>
And a few natural graves."<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  To Jane, his wife,<br>
Thus spake the homely Priest of Ennerdale.<br>
It was a July evening; and he sate<br>
Upon the long stone-seat beneath the eaves                     <br>
Of his old cottage,&mdash;as it chanced, that day,<br>
Employed in winter's work. Upon the stone<br>
His wife sate near him, teasing matted wool,<br>
While, from the twin cards toothed with glittering wire,<br>
He fed the spindle of his youngest child,                      <br>
Who, in the open air, with due accord<br>
Of busy hands and back-and-forward steps,<br>
Her large round wheel was turning. Towards the field<br>
In which the Parish Chapel stood alone,<br>
Girt round with a bare ring of mossy wall,                     <br>
While half an hour went by, the Priest had sent<br>
Many a long look of wonder: and at last,<br>
Risen from his seat, beside the snow white ridge<br>
Of carded wool which the old man had piled<br>
He laid his implements with gentle care,                       <br>
Each in the other locked; and, down the path<br>
That from his cottage to the church-yard led,<br>
He took his way, impatient to accost<br>
The Stranger, whom he saw still lingering there.<br><br>

'Twas one well known to him in former days,                    <br>
A Shepherd-lad; who ere his sixteenth year<br>
Had left that calling, tempted to entrust<br>
His expectations to the fickle winds<br>
And perilous waters; with the mariners<br>
A fellow-mariner;&mdash;and so had fared                            <br>
Through twenty seasons; but he had been reared<br>
Among the mountains, and he in his heart<br>
Was half a shepherd on the stormy seas.<br>
Oft in the piping shrouds had Leonard heard<br>
The tones of waterfalls, and inland sounds                     <br>
Of caves and trees:&mdash;and, when the regular wind<br>
Between the tropics filled the steady sail,<br>
And blew with the same breath through days and weeks,<br>
Lengthening invisibly its weary line<br>
Along the cloudless Main, he, in those hours                   <br>
Of tiresome indolence, would often hang<br>
Over the vessel's side, and gaze and gaze;<br>
And, while the broad blue wave and sparkling foam<br>
Flashed round him images and hues that wrought<br>
In union with the employment of his heart,                     <br>
He, thus by feverish passion overcome,<br>
Even with the organs of his bodily eye,<br>
Below him, in the bosom of the deep,<br>
Saw mountains; saw the forms of sheep that grazed<br>
On verdant hills&mdash;with dwellings among trees,                  <br>
And shepherds clad in the same country grey<br>
Which he himself had worn.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now, at last,<br>
From perils manifold, with some small wealth<br>
Acquired by traffic 'mid the Indian Isles,                 <br>
To his paternal home he is returned,<br>
With a determined purpose to resume<br>
The life he had lived there; both for the sake<br>
Of many darling pleasures, and the love<br>
Which to an only brother he has borne                          <br>
In all his hardships, since that happy time<br>
When, whether it blew foul or fair, they two<br>
Were brother-shepherds on their native hills.<br>
&mdash;They were the last of all their race: and now,<br>
When Leonard had approached his home, his heart                <br>
Failed in him; and, not venturing to enquire<br>
Tidings of one so long and dearly loved,<br>
He to the solitary church-yard turned;<br>
That, as he knew in what particular spot<br>
His family were laid, he thence might learn                    <br>
If still his Brother lived, or to the file<br>
Another grave was added.&mdash;He had found<br>
Another grave,&mdash;near which a full half-hour<br>
He had remained; but, as he gazed, there grew<br>
Such a confusion in his memory,                                <br>
That he began to doubt; and even to hope<br>
That he had seen this heap of turf before,&mdash;<br>
That it was not another grave; but one<br>
He had forgotten. He had lost his path,<br>
As up the vale, that afternoon, he walked                <br>
Through fields which once had been well known to him:<br>
And oh what joy this recollection now<br>
Sent to his heart! he lifted up his eyes,<br>
And, looking round, imagined that he saw<br>
Strange alteration wrought on every side                      <br>
Among the woods and fields, and that the rocks,<br>
And everlasting hills themselves were changed.<br><br>

By this the Priest, who down the field had come,<br>
Unseen by Leonard, at the church-yard gate<br>
Stopped short,&mdash;and thence, at leisure, limb by limb          <br>
Perused him with a gay complacency.<br>
Ay, thought the Vicar, smiling to himself,<br>
'Tis one of those who needs must leave the path<br>
Of the world's business to go wild alone:<br>
His arms have a perpetual holiday;                            <br>
The happy man will creep about the fields,<br>
Following his fancies by the hour, to bring<br>
Tears down his cheek, or solitary smiles<br>
Into his face, until the setting sun<br>
Write fool upon his forehead.&mdash;Planted thus                   <br>
Beneath a shed that over-arched the gate<br>
Of this rude church-yard, till the stars appeared<br>
The good Man might have communed with himself,<br>
But that the Stranger, who had left the grave,<br>
Approached; he recognised the Priest at once,                 <br>
And, after greetings interchanged, and given<br>
By Leonard to the Vicar as to one<br>
Unknown to him, this dialogue ensued.</td>

(It will be twelve years since when Spring returns)<br>
He had gone forth among the new-dropped lambs,<br>
With two or three companions, whom their course<br>
Of occupation led from height to height                       <br>
Under a cloudless sun&mdash;till he, at length,<br>
Through weariness, or, haply, to indulge<br>
The humour of the moment, lagged behind.<br>
You see yon precipice;&mdash;it wears the shape<br>
Of a vast building made of many crags;                   <br>
And in the midst is one particular rock<br>
That rises like a column from the vale,<br>
Whence by our shepherds it is called, <b>The Pillar</b>.<br>
Upon its a&euml;ry summit crowned with heath,<br>
The loiterer, not unnoticed by his comrades,                  <br>
Lay stretched at ease; but, passing by the place<br>
On their return, they found that he was gone.<br>
No ill was feared; till one of them by chance<br>
Entering, when evening was far spent, the house<br>
Which at that time was James's home, there learned       <br>
That nobody had seen him all that day:<br>
The morning came, and still he was unheard of:<br>
The neighbours were alarmed, and to the brook<br>
Some hastened; some ran to the lake: ere noon<br>
They found him at the foot of that same rock                  <br>
Dead, and with mangled limbs. The third day after<br>
I buried him, poor Youth, and there he lies!</td>

The Stranger would have thanked him, but he felt<br>
A gushing from his heart, that took away<br>
The power of speech. Both left the spot in silence;      <br>
And Leonard, when they reached the church-yard gate,<br>
As the Priest lifted up the latch, turned round,&mdash;<br>
And, looking at the grave, he said, "My Brother!"<br>
The Vicar did not hear the words: and now,<br>
He pointed towards his dwelling-place, entreating        <br>
That Leonard would partake his homely fare:<br>
The other thanked him with an earnest voice;<br>
But added, that, the evening being calm,<br>
He would pursue his journey. So they parted.<br><br>

It was not long ere Leonard reached a grove                   <br>
That overhung the road: he there stopped short,<br>
And, sitting down beneath the trees, reviewed<br>
All that the Priest had said: his early years<br>
Were with him:&mdash;his long absence, cherished hopes,<br>
And thoughts which had been his an hour before,               <br>
All pressed on him with such a weight, that now,<br>
This vale, where he had been so happy, seemed <br>
A place in which he could not bear to live:<br>
So he relinquished all his purposes.<br>
He travelled back to Egremont: and thence,               <br>
That night, he wrote a letter to the Priest,<br>
Reminding him of what had passed between them; <br>
And adding, with a hope to be forgiven,<br>
That it was from the weakness of his heart<br>
He had not dared to tell him who he was.                      <br>
This done, he went on shipboard, and is now<br>
A Seaman, a grey-headed Mariner.<br>

<a name="44n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">This poem illustrates the way in which Wordsworth's imagination worked
upon a minimum of fact, idealizing a simple story, and adding</span>

<blockquote>                             'the gleam,<br>
  The light that never was, on sea or land,<br>
  The consecration, and the Poet's dream.'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">It is the only poem of his referring to Ennerdale; but perhaps the chief
association with that dale, to those who visit it after becoming
acquainted with this poem, will be the fact that the brothers Ewbank
were supposed to have spent their youth under the shadow of the Pillar,
and Leonard to have had this conversation, on his return from sea, with
the venerable priest of Ennerdale. The district is described with all
that local accuracy which Wordsworth invariably showed in idealization.
The height whence James Ewbank is supposed to have fallen is not the
Pillar-Rock&mdash;a crag somewhat difficult to ascend, except by practised
climbers, and which has only been accessible since mountaineering became
an art and a passion to Englishmen. But, if we suppose the conversation
with the priest of Ennerdale to have taken place at the Bridge, below
the Lake&mdash;as that is the only place where there is both a hamlet and "a
churchyard"&mdash;the "precipice" will refer to the Pillar "Mountain." Both
are alluded to in the poem. The lines,</span>

<blockquote>You see yon precipice;&mdash;it wears the shape<br>
Of a vast building made of many crags;<br>
And in the midst is one particular rock<br>
That rises like a column from the vale,<br>
Whence by our shepherds it is called, <i>The Pillar</i>,</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">are definite enough. The great mass of the Pillar Mountain is first
referred to, and then the Rock which is a characteristic spur, halfway
up the mountain on its northern side. The "a&euml;ry summit crowned with
heath," however, on which "the loiterer" "lay stretched at ease," could
neither be the top of this "rock" nor the summit of the "mountain": not
the former, because there is no heath on it, and it would be impossible
for a weary man, loitering behind his companions, to ascend it to rest;
not the latter, because no one resting on the summit of the mountain
could be "not unnoticed by his comrades," and they would not pass that
way over the top of the mountain "on their return" to Ennerdale. This is
an instance, therefore, in which precise localization is impossible.
Probably Wordsworth did not know either that the pillar "rock" was bare
on the summit, or that it had never been ascended in 1800; and he
idealised it to suit his imaginative purpose. In connection with this
poem, a remark he made to the Hon. Mr. Justice Coleridge may be
recalled.</span>

<blockquote>  "He said there was some foundation in fact, however slight, for every
  poem he had written of a narrative kind; ... <i>The Brothers</i> was
  founded on a young shepherd, in his sleep, having fallen down a crag,
  his staff remaining suspended mid-way."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">(See the <i>Memoirs of Wordsworth</i>, by the late Bishop of Lincoln,
vol. ii. p. 305.) It should be added that the character of Leonard
Ewbank was drawn in large part from that of the poet's brother John&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

Character, in the antithetical Manner</i>. It was omitted from all
subsequent editions till 1837. With this early friend, Robert Jones&mdash;a
fellow collegian at St. John's College, Cambridge&mdash;Wordsworth visited
the Continent (France and Switzerland), during the long vacation of
1790; and to him he dedicated the first edition of <i>Descriptive
Sketches</i>, in 1793. With him he also made a pedestrian tour in Wales in
1791. Jones afterwards became the incumbent of Soulderne, near
Deddington, in Oxfordshire; and Wordsworth described his parsonage there
in the sonnet, beginning "Where holy ground begins, unhallowed ends."

333.)&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<br>
The text of this poem underwent so many changes, which are not easily
shown by the plan adopted throughout this edition&mdash;portions of the
earliest version of 1800 being abandoned and again adopted, and the
whole arrangement of the passages being altered&mdash;that it seems desirable
to append the entire text of 1800, and extensive parts of that of
subsequent years. The final text of 1832 is printed above.

The text of the editions of 1802 and 1805 (which are identical), omits
one line of the text of 1800. The passage reads:

<a name="48n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp;<span style="color: #555555;"> The "shapeless heap of stones" in St. Herbert's Island, which were
"desolate ruins" in 1800, are even more "shapeless" and "desolate" now,
but they can easily be identified. The island is near the centre of the
lake, and is in area about four acres. The legend of St. Herbert dates
from the middle of the seventh century. The rector of Clifton,
Westmoreland, Dr. Robinson, writing in 1819, says:</span>

  <blockquote>"The remains of his hermitage are still visible, being built of stone
  and mortar, and formed into two apartments, one of which, about twenty
  feet long and sixteen feet wide, seems to have been his chapel; the
  other, of less dimensions, his cell. Near these ruins the late Sir
  Wilfred Lawson (to whose representative the island at present belongs)
  erected some years ago a small octagonal cottage, which, being built
  of unhewn stone, and artificially mossed over, has a venerable
  appearance."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">(See <i>Guide to the Lakes</i>, by John Robinson, D.D., 1819). This cottage
has now disappeared. The following version of this "Inscription" occurs
in a letter from Wordsworth to Lady Beaumont, dated 26th November 1811:</span>

  <blockquote>This Island, guarded from profane approach<br>
  By mountains high and waters widely spread,<br>
  Gave to St. Herbert a benign retreat.<br>
  Upon a staff supported, and his Brow<br>
  White with the peaceful diadem of age.<br>
  Hither he came&mdash;a self-secluded Man,<br>
  ...<br>
  Behold that shapeless Heap of stones and earth!<br>
  "Tis reverenced as a Vestige of the Abode<br>
  ...<br>
  ...      &mdash;And when within his Cell<br>
  Alone he knelt before the crucifix,</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">In a previous letter to Sir George Beaumont, dated 16th November 1811:</span>

  <blockquote>By mountains high and waters widely spread,<br>
  Is that Seclusion which St. Herbert chose;<br>
  ...<br>
  Hither he came in life's austere decline:<br>
  And, Stranger! this blank Heap of stones and earth<br>
  Is reverenced ...</blockquote>

And hither does one Poet sometimes row<br>
His pinnace, a small vagrant barge, up-piled<br>
With plenteous store of heath and withered fern,<br>
(A lading which he with his sickle cuts,                       <br>
Among the mountains) and beneath this roof<br>
He makes his summer couch, and here at noon<br>
Spreads out his limbs, while, yet unshorn, the Sheep,<br>
Panting beneath the burthen of their wool,<br>
Lie round him, even as if they were a part                     <br>
Of his own Household: nor, while from his bed<br>
He looks, through the open door-place, toward the lake<br>
And to the stirring breezes, does he want<br>
Creations lovely as the work of sleep&mdash;<br>
Fair sights, and visions of romantic joy!                      <br>

Of those domestic tales that spake to me<br>
Of Shepherds, dwellers in the valleys, men<br>
Whom I already loved;&mdash;not verily<br>
For their own sakes, but for the fields and hills                  <br>
Where was their occupation and abode.<br>
And hence this Tale, while I was yet a Boy<br>
Careless of books, yet having felt the power<br>
Of Nature, by the gentle agency<br>
Of natural objects, led me on to feel                              <br>
For passions that were not my own, and think<br>
(At random and imperfectly indeed)<br>
On man, the heart of man, and human life.<br>
Therefore, although it be a history<br>
Homely and rude, I will relate the same                            <br>
For the delight of a few natural hearts;<br>
And, with yet fonder feeling, for the sake<br>
Of youthful Poets, who among these hills<br>
Will be my second self when I am gone.<br><br>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Upon the forest-side in Grasmere Vale                            <br>
There dwelt a Shepherd, Michael was his name;<br>
An old man, stout of heart, and strong of limb.<br>
His bodily frame had been from youth to age<br>
Of an unusual strength: his mind was keen,<br>
Intense, and frugal, apt for all affairs,                          <br>
And in his shepherd's calling he was prompt<br>
And watchful more than ordinary men.<br>
Hence had he learned the meaning of all winds,<br>
Of blasts of every tone; and, oftentimes,<br>
When others heeded not, He heard the South                         <br>
Make subterraneous music, like the noise<br>
Of bagpipers on distant Highland hills.<br>
The Shepherd, at such warning, of his flock<br>
Bethought him, and he to himself would say,<br>
"The winds are now devising work for me!"                          <br>
And, truly, at all times, the storm, that drives<br>
The traveller to a shelter, summoned him<br>
Up to the mountains: he had been alone<br>
Amid the heart of many thousand mists,<br>
That came to him, and left him, on the heights.                    <br>
So lived he till his eightieth year was past.<br>
And grossly that man errs, who should suppose<br>
That the green valleys, and the streams and rocks,<br>
Were things indifferent to the Shepherd's thoughts.<br>
Fields, where with cheerful spirits he had breathed                <br>
The common air; hills, which with vigorous step<br>
He had so often climbed; which had impressed<br>
So many incidents upon his mind<br>
Of hardship, skill or courage, joy or fear;<br>
Which, like a book, preserved the memory                           <br>
Of the dumb animals, whom he had saved,<br>
Had fed or sheltered, linking to such acts<br>
The certainty of honourable gain;<br>
Those fields, those hills&mdash;what could they less? had laid<br>
Strong hold on his affections, were to him                         <br>
A pleasurable feeling of blind love,<br>
The pleasure which there is in life itself.<br><br>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  His days had not been passed in singleness.<br>
His Helpmate was a comely matron, old&mdash;<br>
Though younger than himself full twenty years.                     <br>
She was a woman of a stirring life,<br>
Whose heart was in her house: two wheels she had<br>
Of antique form; this large, for spinning wool;<br>
That small, for flax; and if one wheel had rest,<br>
It was because the other was at work.                              <br>
The Pair had but one inmate in their house,<br>
An only Child, who had been born to them<br>
When Michael, telling o'er his years, began<br>
To deem that he was old,&mdash;in shepherd's phrase,<br>
With one foot in the grave. This only Son,                         <br>
With two brave sheep-dogs tried in many a storm,<br>
The one of an inestimable worth,<br>
Made all their household. I may truly say,<br>
That they were as a proverb in the vale<br>
For endless industry. When day was gone,                           <br>
And from their occupations out of doors<br>
The Son and Father were come home, even then,<br>
Their labour did not cease; unless when all<br>
Turned to the cleanly supper-board, and there,<br>
Each with a mess of pottage and skimmed milk,                     <br>
Sat round the basket piled with oaten cakes,<br>
And their plain home-made cheese. Yet when the meal<br>
Was ended, Luke (for so the Son was named)<br>
And his old Father both betook themselves<br>
To such convenient work as might employ                           <br>
Their hands by the fire-side; perhaps to card<br>
Wool for the Housewife's spindle, or repair<br>
Some injury done to sickle, flail, or scythe,<br>
Or other implement of house or field.<br><br>

Down from the ceiling, by the chimney's edge,                     <br>
That in our ancient uncouth country style<br>
With huge and black projection overbrowed<br>
Large space beneath, as duly as the light<br>
Of day grew dim the Housewife hung a lamp;<br>
An aged utensil, which had performed                              <br>
Service beyond all others of its kind.<br>
Early at evening did it burn&mdash;and late,<br>
Surviving comrade of uncounted hours,<br>
Which, going by from year to year, had found,<br>
And left the couple neither gay perhaps                           <br>
Nor cheerful, yet with objects and with hopes,<br>
Living a life of eager industry.<br>
And now, when Luke had reached his eighteenth year,<br>
There by the light of this old lamp they sate,<br>
Father and Son, while far into the night                     <br>
The Housewife plied her own peculiar work,<br>
Making the cottage through the silent hours<br>
Murmur as with the sound of summer flies.<br>
This light was famous in its neighbourhood,<br>
And was a public symbol of the life                               <br>
That thrifty Pair had lived. For, as it chanced,<br>
Their cottage on a plot of rising ground<br>
Stood single, with large prospect, north and south,<br>
High into Easedale, up to Dunmail-Raise,<br>
And westward to the village near the lake;                        <br>
And from this constant light, so regular<br>
And so far seen, the House itself, by all<br>
Who dwelt within the limits of the vale,<br>
Both old and young, was named <b>The Evening Star</b>.<br><br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus living on through such a length of years,                  <br>
The Shepherd, if he loved himself, must needs<br>
Have loved his Helpmate; but to Michael's heart<br>
This son of his old age was yet more dear&mdash;<br>
Less from instinctive tenderness, the same<br>
Fond spirit that blindly works in the blood of all&mdash;         <br>
Than that a child, more than all other gifts<br>
That earth can offer to declining man,<br>
Brings hope with it, and forward-looking thoughts,<br>
And stirrings of inquietude, when they<br>
By tendency of nature needs must fail.                            <br>
Exceeding was the love he bare to him,<br>
His heart and his heart's joy! For oftentimes<br>
Old Michael, while he was a babe in arms,<br>
Had done him female service, not alone<br>
For pastime and delight, as is the use                       <br>
Of fathers, but with patient mind enforced<br>
To acts of tenderness; and he had rocked<br>
His cradle, as with a woman's gentle hand.<br>
And, in a later time, ere yet the Boy<br>
Had put on boy's attire, did Michael love,                        <br>
Albeit of a stern unbending mind,<br>
To have the Young-one in his sight, when he<br>
Wrought in the field, or on his shepherd's stool<br>
Sate with a fettered sheep before him stretched<br>
Under the large old oak, that near his door                       <br>
Stood single, and, from matchless depth of shade,<br>
Chosen for the Shearer's covert from the sun,<br>
Thence in our rustic dialect was called<br>
The <b>Clipping Tree</b>, a name which yet it bears.<br>
There, while they two were sitting in the shade,                  <br>
With others round them, earnest all and blithe,<br>
Would Michael exercise his heart with looks<br>
Of fond correction and reproof bestowed<br>
Upon the Child, if he disturbed the sheep<br>
By catching at their legs, or with his shouts                     <br>
Scared them, while they lay still beneath the shears.<br><br>

And when by Heaven's good grace the boy grew up<br>
A healthy Lad, and carried in his cheek<br>
Two steady roses that were five years old;<br>
Then Michael from a winter coppice cut                            <br>
With his own hand a sapling, which he hooped<br>
With iron, making it throughout in all<br>
Due requisites a perfect shepherd's staff,<br>
And gave it to the Boy; wherewith equipt<br>
He as a watchman oftentimes was placed                            <br>
At gate or gap, to stem or turn the flock;<br>
And, to his office prematurely called,<br>
There stood the urchin, as you will divine,<br>
Something between a hindrance and a help;<br>
And for this cause not always, I believe,                         <br>
Receiving from his Father hire of praise;<br>
Though nought was left undone which staff, or voice,<br>
Or looks, or threatening gestures, could perform.<br><br>

But soon as Luke, full ten years old, could stand<br>
Against the mountain blasts; and to the heights,                  <br>
Not fearing toil, nor length of weary ways,<br>
He with his Father daily went, and they<br>
Were as companions, why should I relate<br>
That objects which the Shepherd loved before<br>
Were dearer now? that from the Boy there came                     <br>
Feelings and emanations&mdash;things which were<br>
Light to the sun and music to the wind;<br>
And that the old Man's heart seemed born again?<br><br>

Thus in his Father's sight the Boy grew up:<br>
And now, when he had reached his eighteenth year,                 <br>
He was his comfort and his daily hope.<br><br>

While in this sort the simple household lived<br>
From day to day, to Michael's ear there came<br>
Distressful tidings. Long before the time<br>
Of which I speak, the Shepherd had been bound                     <br>
In surety for his brother's son, a man<br>
Of an industrious life, and ample means;<br>
But unforeseen misfortunes suddenly<br>
Had prest upon him; and old Michael now<br>
Was summoned to discharge the forfeiture,                         <br>
A grievous penalty, but little less<br>
Than half his substance. This unlooked-for claim,<br>
At the first hearing, for a moment took<br>
More hope out of his life than he supposed<br>
That any old man ever could have lost.                            <br>
As soon as he had armed himself with strength<br>
To look his trouble in the face, it seemed<br>
The Shepherd's sole resource to sell at once<br>
A portion of his patrimonial fields.<br>
Such was his first resolve; he thought again,                     <br>
And his heart failed him. "Isabel," said he,<br>
Two evenings after he had heard the news,<br>
"I have been toiling more than seventy years,<br>
And in the open sunshine of God's love<br>
Have we all lived; yet if these fields of ours                    <br>
Should pass into a stranger's hand, I think<br>
That I could not lie quiet in my grave.<br>
Our lot is a hard lot; the sun himself<br>
Has scarcely been more diligent than I;<br>
And I have lived to be a fool at last                             <br>
To my own family. An evil man<br>
That was, and made an evil choice, if he<br>
Were false to us; and if he were not false,<br>
There are ten thousand to whom loss like this<br>
Had been no sorrow. I forgive him;&mdash;but                           <br>
'Twere better to be dumb than to talk thus.<br><br>

"When I began, my purpose was to speak<br>
Of remedies and of a cheerful hope.<br>
Our Luke shall leave us, Isabel; the land<br>
Shall not go from us, and it shall be free;                       <br>
He shall possess it, free as is the wind<br>
That passes over it. We have, thou know'st,<br>
Another kinsman&mdash;he will be our friend<br>
In this distress. He is a prosperous man,<br>
Thriving in trade&mdash;and Luke to him shall go,                      <br>
And with his kinsman's help and his own thrift<br>
He quickly will repair this loss, and then<br>
He may return to us. If here he stay,<br>
What can be done? Where every one is poor,<br>
What can be gained?"                                              <br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;               At this the old Man paused,<br>
And Isabel sat silent, for her mind<br>
Was busy, looking back into past times.<br>
There's Richard Bateman, thought she to herself,<br>
He was a parish-boy&mdash;at the church-door                           <br>
They made a gathering for him, shillings, pence<br>
And halfpennies, wherewith the neighbours bought<br>
A basket, which they filled with pedlar's wares;<br>
And, with this basket on his arm, the lad<br>
Went up to London, found a master there,                          <br>
Who, out of many, chose the trusty boy<br>
To go and overlook his merchandise<br>
Beyond the seas; where he grew wondrous rich,<br>
And left estates and monies to the poor,<br>
And, at his birth-place, built a chapel floored                   <br>
With marble, which he sent from foreign lands.<br>
These thoughts, and many others of like sort,<br>
Passed quickly through the mind of Isabel,<br>
And her face brightened. The old Man was glad,<br>
And thus resumed:&mdash;"Well, Isabel! this scheme                     <br>
These two days, has been meat and drink to me.<br>
Far more than we have lost is left us yet.<br>
&mdash;We have enough&mdash;I wish indeed that I<br>
Were younger;&mdash;but this hope is a good hope.<br>
Make ready Luke's best garments, of the best                      <br>
Buy for him more, and let us send him forth <br>
To-morrow, or the next day, or to-night:<br>
&mdash;If he <i>could</i> go, the Boy should go to-night."<br><br>

Here Michael ceased, and to the fields went forth<br>
With a light heart. The Housewife for five days               <br>
Was restless morn and night, and all day long<br>
Wrought on with her best fingers to prepare<br>
Things needful for the journey of her son.<br>
But Isabel was glad when Sunday came<br>
To stop her in her work: for, when she lay                        <br>
By Michael's side, she through the last two nights<br>
Heard him, how he was troubled in his sleep:<br>
And when they rose at morning she could see<br>
That all his hopes were gone. That day at noon<br>
She said to Luke, while they two by themselves                    <br>
Were sitting at the door, "Thou must not go:<br>
We have no other Child but thee to lose,<br>
None to remember&mdash;do not go away,<br>
For if thou leave thy Father he will die."<br>
The Youth made answer with a jocund voice;                   <br>
And Isabel, when she had told her fears,<br>
Recovered heart. That evening her best fare<br>
Did she bring forth, and all together sat<br>
Like happy people round a Christmas fire.<br><br>

With daylight Isabel resumed her work;                       <br>
And all the ensuing week the house appeared<br>
As cheerful as a grove in Spring: at length<br>
The expected letter from their kinsman came,<br>
With kind assurances that he would do<br>
His utmost for the welfare of the Boy;                            <br>
To which, requests were added, that forthwith<br>
He might be sent to him. Ten times or more<br>
The letter was read over; Isabel<br>
Went forth to show it to the neighbours round;<br>
Nor was there at that time on English land                        <br>
A prouder heart than Luke's. When Isabel<br>
Had to her house returned, the old Man said,<br>
"He shall depart to-morrow." To this word<br>
The Housewife answered, talking much of things<br>
Which, if at such short notice he should go,                      <br>
Would surely be forgotten. But at length<br>
She gave consent, and Michael was at ease.<br><br>

Near the tumultuous brook of Green-head Ghyll,<br>
In that deep valley, Michael had designed<br>
To build a Sheep-fold; and, before he heard                   <br>
The tidings of his melancholy loss,<br>
For this same purpose he had gathered up<br>
A heap of stones, which by the streamlet's edge<br>
Lay thrown together, ready for the work.<br>
With Luke that evening thitherward he walked:                     <br>
And soon as they had reached the place he stopped,<br>
And thus the old Man spake to him:&mdash;"My Son,<br>
To-morrow thou wilt leave me: with full heart<br>
I look upon thee, for thou art the same<br>
That wert a promise to me ere thy birth,                          <br>
And all thy life hast been my daily joy.<br>
I will relate to thee some little part<br>
Of our two histories; 'twill do thee good<br>
When thou art from me, even if I should touch<br>
On things thou canst not know of.&mdash;After thou                <br>
First cam'st into the world&mdash;as oft befals<br>
To new-born infants&mdash;thou didst sleep away<br>
Two days, and blessings from thy Father's tongue<br>
Then fell upon thee. Day by day passed on,<br>
And still I loved thee with increasing love.                      <br>
Never to living ear came sweeter sounds<br>
Than when I heard thee by our own fire-side<br>
First uttering, without words, a natural tune;<br>
While thou, a feeding babe, didst in thy joy<br>
Sing at thy Mother's breast. Month followed month,                <br>
And in the open fields my life was passed<br>
And on the mountains; else I think that thou<br>
Hadst been brought up upon thy Father's knees.<br>
But we were playmates, Luke: among these hills,<br>
As well thou knowest, in us the old and young                     <br>
Have played together, nor with me didst thou<br>
Lack any pleasure which a boy can know."<br>
Luke had a manly heart; but at these words<br>
He sobbed aloud. The old Man grasped his hand,<br>
And said, "Nay, do not take it so&mdash;I see                          <br>
That these are things of which I need not speak.<br>
&mdash;Even to the utmost I have been to thee<br>
A kind and a good Father: and herein<br>
I but repay a gift which I myself<br>
Received at others' hands; for, though now old                    <br>
Beyond the common life of man, I still<br>
Remember them who loved me in my youth.<br>
Both of them sleep together: here they lived,<br>
As all their Forefathers had done; and when<br>
At length their time was come, they were not loth                 <br>
To give their bodies to the family mould.<br>
I wished that thou should'st live the life they lived:<br>
But, 'tis a long time to look back, my Son,<br>
And see so little gain from threescore years.<br>
These fields were burthened when they came to me;                 <br>
Till I was forty years of age, not more<br>
Than half of my inheritance was mine.<br>
I toiled and toiled; God blessed me in my work,<br>
And till these three weeks past the land was free.<br>
&mdash;It looks as if it never could endure                            <br>
Another Master. Heaven forgive me, Luke,<br>
If I judge ill for thee, but it seems good<br>
That thou should'st go,"<br><br>

At this the old Man paused;<br>
Then, pointing to the stones near which they stood,               <br>
Thus, after a short silence, he resumed:<br>
"This was a work for us; and now, my Son,<br>
It is a work for me. But, lay one stone&mdash;<br>
Here, lay it for me, Luke, with thine own hands.<br>
Nay, Boy, be of good hope;&mdash;we both may live                 <br>
To see a better day. At eighty-four<br>
I still am strong and hale;&mdash;do thou thy part;<br>
I will do mine.&mdash;I will begin again<br>
With many tasks that were resigned to thee:<br>
Up to the heights, and in among the storms,                       <br>
Will I without thee go again, and do<br>
All works which I was wont to do alone,<br>
Before I knew thy face.&mdash;Heaven bless thee, Boy!<br>
Thy heart these two weeks has been beating fast<br>
With many hopes; it should be so&mdash;yes&mdash;yes&mdash;                      <br>
I knew that thou could'st never have a wish<br>
To leave me, Luke: thou hast been bound to me<br>
Only by links of love: when thou art gone,<br>
What will be left to us!&mdash;But, I forget<br>
My purposes. Lay now the corner-stone,                            <br>
As I requested; and hereafter, Luke,<br>
When thou art gone away, should evil men<br>
Be thy companions, think of me, my Son,<br>
And of this moment; hither turn thy thoughts,<br>
And God will strengthen thee: amid all fear                       <br>
And all temptation, Luke, I pray that thou<br>
May'st bear in mind the life thy Fathers lived,<br>
Who, being innocent, did for that cause<br>
Bestir them in good deeds. Now, fare thee well&mdash;<br>
When thou return'st, thou in this place wilt see                  <br>
A work which is not here: a covenant<br>
'Twill be between us; but, whatever fate<br>
Befal thee, I shall love thee to the last,<br>
And bear thy memory with me to the grave."<br><br>

The Shepherd ended here; and Luke stooped down,                   <br>
And, as his Father had requested, laid<br>
The first stone of the Sheep-fold. At the sight<br>
The old Man's grief broke from him; to his heart<br>
He pressed his Son, he kiss&egrave;d him and wept;<br>
And to the house together they returned.                          <br>
&mdash;Hushed was that House in peace, or seeming peace,<br>
Ere the night fell:&mdash;with morrow's dawn the Boy<br>
Began his journey, and when he had reached<br>
The public way, he put on a bold face;<br>
And all the neighbours, as he passed their doors,                 <br>
Came forth with wishes and with farewell prayers,<br>
That followed him till he was out of sight.<br><br>

A good report did from their Kinsman come,<br>
Of Luke and his well doing: and the Boy<br>
Wrote loving letters, full of wondrous news,                      <br>
Which, as the Housewife phrased it, were throughout<br>
"The prettiest letters that were ever seen."<br>
Both parents read them with rejoicing hearts.<br>
So, many months passed on: and once again<br>
The Shepherd went about his daily work                            <br>
With confident and cheerful thoughts; and now<br>
Sometimes when he could find a leisure hour<br>
He to that valley took his way, and there<br>
Wrought at the Sheep-fold. Meantime Luke began<br>
To slacken in his duty; and, at length,                           <br>
He in the dissolute city gave himself<br>
To evil courses: ignominy and shame<br>
Fell on him, so that he was driven at last<br>
To seek a hiding-place beyond the seas.<br><br>

There is a comfort in the strength of love;                       <br>
'Twill make a thing endurable, which else<br>
Would overset the brain, or break the heart:<br>
I have conversed with more than one who well<br>
Remember the old Man, and what he was<br>
Years after he had heard this heavy news.                         <br>
His bodily frame had been from youth to age<br>
Of an unusual strength. Among the rocks<br>
He went, and still looked up to sun and cloud,<br>
And listened to the wind; and, as before,<br>
Performed all kinds of labour for his sheep,                      <br>
And for the land, his small inheritance.<br>
And to that hollow dell from time to time<br>
Did he repair, to build the Fold of which<br>
His flock had need. 'Tis not forgotten yet<br>
The pity which was then in every heart                            <br>
For the old Man&mdash;and 'tis believed by all<br>
That many and many a day he thither went,<br>
And never lifted up a single stone.<br><br>

There, by the Sheep-fold, sometimes was he seen<br>
Sitting alone, or with his faithful Dog,                     <br>
Then old, beside him, lying at his feet.<br>
The length of full seven years, from time to time,<br>
He at the building of this Sheep-fold wrought,<br>
And left the work unfinished when he died.<br>
Three years, or little more, did Isabel                           <br>
Survive her Husband: at her death the estate<br>
Was sold, and went into a stranger's hand.<br>
The Cottage which was named the <b>Evening Star</b><br>
Is gone&mdash;the ploughshare has been through the ground<br>
On which it stood; great changes have been wrought                <br>
In all the neighbourhood:&mdash;yet the oak is left<br>
That grew beside their door; and the remains<br>
Of the unfinished Sheep-fold may be seen<br>
Beside the boisterous brook of Green-head Ghyll.<br>

  rebuilt in 1743 by Robert Bateman, stands in the village of Ings,
  which is in this chapelry. The free school was endowed with land in
  1650 by Roland Wilson, producing at present &pound;12 per annum. The average
  number of boys is twenty-five. This endowment was augmented by &pound;8 per
  annum by Robert Bateman, who gave &pound;1000 for purchasing an estate, and
  erected eight alms-houses for as many poor families, besides a
  donation of &pound;12 per annum to the curate. This worthy benefactor was

<a name="50n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">From the Fenwick note it will be seen that Michael's sheep-fold, in
Green-head Ghyll, existed&mdash;at least the remains of it&mdash; in 1843. Its
site, however, is now very difficult to identify. There is a sheep-fold
above Boon Beck, which one passes immediately on entering the common,
going up Green-head Ghyll. It is now "finished," and used when required.
There are remains of walling, much higher up the ghyll; but these are
probably the work of miners, formerly engaged there. Michael's cottage
had been destroyed when the poem was written, in 1800. It stood where
the coach-house and stables of "the Hollins" now stand. But one who
visits Green-head Ghyll, and wishes to realize Michael in his old
age&mdash;as described in this poem&mdash;should ascend the ghyll till it almost
reaches the top of Fairfield; where the old man, during eighty years,</span>

<blockquote>'had learned the meaning of all winds,<br>
  Of blasts of every tone,'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">and where he</span>

<blockquote>'had been alone,<br>
  Amid the heart of many thousand mists,<br>
  That came to him, and left him, on the heights.'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">By so doing he will be better able to realize the spirit of the poem,
than by trying to identify the site either of the "unfinished
sheep-fold," or of the house named the "Evening Star." What Wordsworth
said to the Hon. Mr. Justice Coleridge in reference to <i>The Brothers</i>
has been quoted in the note to that poem, p. 203. On the same occasion
he remarked, in reference to <i>Michael:&mdash;</i></span>

<blockquote>"<i>Michael</i> was founded on the
son of an old couple having become dissolute, and run away from his
parents; and on an old shepherd having been seven years in building up a
sheep-fold in a solitary valley."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">(<i>Memoirs of Wordsworth</i>, by the late
Bishop of Lincoln, vol. ii. p. 305.)<br>
<br>
The following extracts from Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Grasmere Journal,</i> show
the carefulness with which the poem <i>Michael</i> was composed, and the
frequent revisions which it underwent:&mdash;</span>

<blockquote>  Oct. 11 [1800.] "We walked up Green-head ghyll in search of a
  sheepfold.... The sheepfold is falling away. It is built nearly in the
  form of a heart unequally divided."<br>
<br>
  13. "William composing in the evening."<br>
<br>
  15. "W. composed a little." ... "W. again composed at the sheepfold
  after dinner."<br>
<br>
  18. "W. worked all the morning at the sheepfold, but in vain. He lay
  down till 7 o'clock, but did not sleep."<br>
<br>
  19. "William got to work."<br>
<br>
  20. "W. worked in the morning at the sheepfold."<br>
<br>
  21. "W. had been unsuccessful in the morning at the sheepfold."<br>
<br>
  22. "W. composed, without much success, at the sheepfold."<br>
<br>
  23. "W. was not successful in composition in the evening."<br>
<br>
  24. "W. was only partly successful in composition."<br>
<br>
  26. "W. composed a good deal all the morning."<br>
<br>
  28. "W. could not compose much; fatigued himself with altering."<br>
<br>
  30. "W. worked at his poem all the morning."<br>
<br>
  Nov. 10. "W. at the sheepfold."<br>
<br>
  12. "W. has been working at the sheepfold."<br>
<br>
  Dec. 9. "W. finished his poem to-day."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">It is impossible to say with certainty that the entry under Dec. 9
refers to <i>Michael</i>, but if it does, it is evident that Wordsworth
wrought continuously at this poem for nearly two months.<br>
<br>
On April 9, 1801, Wordsworth wrote to Thomas Poole:</span>

<blockquote>  "In writing it" (<i>Michael</i>), "I had your character often before
  my eyes; and sometimes thought that I was delineating such a man as
  you yourself would have been, under the same circumstances."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The following is part of a letter written by Wordsworth to Charles James
Fox in 1802, and sent with a copy of "Lyrical Ballads":</span>

<blockquote>  "In the two poems, <i>The Brothers</i> and <i>Michael</i>, I have
  attempted to draw a picture of the domestic affections, as I know they
  exist amongst a class of men who are now almost confined to the north
  of England. They are small independent <i>proprietors</i> of land,
  here called 'statesmen,' men of respectable education, who daily
  labour on their own little properties. The domestic affections will
  always be strong amongst men who live in a country not crowded with
  population; if these men are placed above poverty. But, if they are
  proprietors of small estates which have descended to them from their
  ancestors, the power which these affections will acquire amongst such
  men, is inconceivable by those who have only had an opportunity of
  observing hired labourers, farmers, and the manufacturing poor. Their
  little tract of land serves as a kind of permanent rallying point for
  their domestic feelings, as a tablet on which they are written, which
  makes them objects of memory in a thousand instances, when they would
  otherwise be forgotten. It is a fountain fitted to the nature of
  social man, from which supplies of affection as pure as his heart was
  intended for, are daily drawn. This class of men is rapidly
  disappearing.... The two poems that I have mentioned were written with
  a view to show that men who do not wear fine clothes can feel deeply.
  <i>Pectus enim est quod disertos facit, et vis mentis. Ideoque imperitis
  quoque, si modo sint aliquo affectu concitati, verba non desunt.</i> The
  poems are faithful copies from nature; and I hope whatever effect they
  may have upon you, you will at least be able to perceive that they may
  excite profitable sympathies in many kind and good hearts; and may in
  some small degree enlarge our feelings of reverence for our species,
  and our knowledge of human nature, by showing that our best qualities
  are possessed by men whom we are too apt to consider, not with
  reference to the points in which they resemble us, but to those in
  which they manifestly differ from us."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">A number of fragments, originally meant to be parts of
<i>Michael</i>,&mdash;or at least written with such a possibility in view,&mdash;
will be found in the Appendix to the eighth volume of this edition.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<span style="color: #555555;"><i>The Sparrow's Nest</i>, and the sonnet on Skiddaw, along with some
translations from Chaucer, belong to the year 1801. During this year,
however, <i>The Excursion</i> was in progress. In its earlier stages, and
before the plan of 'The Recluse' was matured, the introductory part was
familiarly known, and talked of in the Wordsworth household, by the name
of "The Pedlar." The following extracts from Dorothy Wordsworth's
Journal of 1801 will show the progress that was being made with it:</span>

  <blockquote>"Dec. 21.&mdash;Wm. sate beside me, and wrote <i>The Pedlar.</i> <br>
<br>
22nd.&mdash;W.
  composed a few lines of <i>The Pedlar.</i> <br>
<br>
23rd.&mdash; William worked at <i>The
  Ruined Cottage</i>" (this was the name of the first part of 'The
  Excursion', in which <i>The Pedlar</i> was included), "and made himself
  very ill," etc.</blockquote>

<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[<a name="fr52A">Written</a> in the orchard, Town-end, Grasmere. At the end of the garden of
my father's house at Cockermouth was a high terrace that commanded a
fine view of the river Derwent and Cockermouth Castle. This was our
favourite play-ground. The terrace wall, a low one, was covered with
closely-clipt privet and roses, which gave an almost impervious shelter
to birds who built their nests there. The latter of these stanzas<a href="#52A"><sup>A</sup></a>
alludes to one of those nests.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">This poem was first published in the series entitled "Moods of my own
Mind," in 1807. In 1815 it was included among the "Poems founded on the
Affections," and in 1845 was transferred to the "Poems referring to the
Period of Childhood." &mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<h2><a name="section54"></a>Selections from Chaucer (Modernised)</h2>

<span style="color: #555555;">Wordsworth's modernisations of Chaucer were all written in 1801. Two of
them were from the Canterbury Tales, but his version of one of
these&mdash;<i>The Manciple's Tale</i>&mdash;has never been printed. Of the three
poems which were published, the first&mdash;<i>The Prioress' Tale</i>&mdash;was
included in the edition of 1820. The <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> and
<i>The Cuckoo and the Nightingale</i> were included in the "Poems of
Early and Late Years" (1842); but they had been published the year
before, in a small volume entitled <i>The Poems of Geoffrey Chaucer
Modernised</i> (London, 1841), a volume to which Elizabeth Barrett,
Leigh Hunt, R. H. Home, Thomas Powell, and others contributed.
Wordsworth wrote thus of the project to Mr. Powell, in an unpublished
and undated letter, written probably in 1840:</span>

  <blockquote>"I am glad that you enter so warmly into the Chaucerian project, and
  that Mr. L. Hunt is disposed to give his valuable aid to it. For
  myself, I cannot do more than I offered, to place at your disposal
  <i>The Prioress' Tale</i> already published, <i>The Cuckoo and the
  Nightingale</i>, <i>The Manciple's Tale</i>, and I rather think (but I
  cannot just now find it) a small portion of the <i>Troilus and
  Cressida</i>. You ask my opinion about that poem. Speaking from a
  recollection only, of many years past, I should say it would be found
  too long and probably tedious. <i>The Knight's Tale</i> is also very
  long; but, though Dryden has executed it, in his own way observe, with
  great spirit and harmony, he has suffered so much of the simplicity,
  and with that of the beauty and occasional pathos of the original to
  escape, that I should be pleased to hear that a new version was to be
  attempted upon my principle by some competent person. It would delight
  me to read every part of Chaucer over again&mdash;for I reverence and
  admire him above measure&mdash;with a view to your work; but my eyes will
  not permit me to do so. Who will undertake the Prologue to the
  Canterbury Tales? For your publication that is indispensable, and I
  fear it will prove very difficult. It is written, as you know, in the
  couplet measure; and therefore I have nothing to say upon its metre,
  but in respect to the poems in stanza, neither in <i>The Prioress'
  Tale</i> nor in <i>The Cuckoo and Nightingale</i> have I kept to the
  rule of the original as to the form, and number, and position of the
  rhymes; thinking it enough if I kept the same number of lines in each
  stanza; and this is, I think, all that is necessary, and all that can
  be done without sacrificing the substance of sense too often to the
  mere form of sound."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">In a subsequent letter to Professor Henry Reed of Philadelphia, dated
"Rydal Mount, January 13th, 1841," Wordsworth said:</span>

  <blockquote>"So great is my admiration of Chaucer's genius, and so profound my
  reverence for him as an instrument in the hands of Providence, for
  spreading the light of literature through his native land, that
  notwithstanding the defects and faults in this publication"
  (referring, I presume, to the volume, <i>The Poems of Geoffrey Chaucer
  Modernised</i>), "I am glad of it, as a means of making many acquainted
  with the original, who would otherwise be ignorant of everything about
  him but his name."</blockquote>

<h4>Translated 1801<a href="#55A"><sup>A</sup></a>.&mdash;Published 1820</h4>

In the following Piece I have allowed myself no farther deviations from
the original than were necessary for the fluent reading, and instant
understanding, of the Author: so much however is the language altered
since Chaucer's time, especially in pronunciation, that much was to be
removed, and its place supplied with as little incongruity as possible.
The ancient accent has been retained in a few conjunctions, such as
<i>also</i> and <i>alway</i>, from a conviction that such sprinklings of antiquity
would be admitted, by persons of taste, to have a graceful accordance
with the subject.&mdash;W. W. (1820).<br>
<br>
The fierce bigotry of the Prioress forms a fine back ground for her
tender-hearted sympathies with the Mother and Child; and the mode in
which the story is told amply atones for the extravagance of the
miracle.&mdash; W. W. (added in 1827).<br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">In the editions of 1820 and 1827 <i>The Prioress' Tale</i> followed <i>The
White Doe of Rylstone</i>. In 1832 it followed the "Inscriptions"; and in
1836 it was included among the "Poems founded on the Affections." In
1845 it found its appropriate place in the "Selections from Chaucer
modernised."&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

   <blockquote> 'So feire oon had I nevere in bene,<br>
    The grounde was grene, y poudred with days&eacute;,<br>
    The floures and the gras ilike al hie,<br>
    Al grene and white, was nothing elles sene.'</blockquote>

  Nothing seen but the short green grass and the white daisies,&mdash;grass
  and daisies being of equal height. Unfortunately in Tyrwhitt's text
  the description is nonsensical,

   <blockquote> 'The flowres and the greves like hie.'</blockquote>

  The daisy flowers are as high as the <i>groves</i>! Wordsworth retained the
  groves, but refused to make daisies of equal height with them.

    <blockquote>'Tall were the flowers, the grove a lofty cover,
    All green and white; and nothing else was seen.'"</blockquote></blockquote>

 <blockquote> "In Chaucer's poem, after 'the cuckoo, bird unholy,' has said his evil
  say, the Nightingale breaks forth 'so lustily,'

   <blockquote> 'That with her clere voys she made rynge<br>
    Thro out alle the grene wode wide,'</blockquote>

  Wordsworth has taken a poet's licence with these lines:

   <blockquote> 'I heard the lusty Nightingale so sing,<br>
    That her clear voice made <i>a loud rioting</i>,<br>
    Echoing through all the green wood wide.'</blockquote>

  This 'loud rioting' is Wordsworth's, not Chaucer's; and it belongs, as
  it were, to that other passage of his:

   <blockquote> 'O Nightingale, thou surely art<br>
    A creature of a fiery heart,<br>
    These notes of thine&mdash;they pierce and pierce;<br>
    Tumultuous harmony and fierce!<br>
    Thou sing'st as if the God of wine<br>
    Had helped thee to a Valentine.'"</blockquote></blockquote>

<td>Next morning Troilus began to clear                             <br>
His eyes from sleep, at the first break of day,<br>
And unto Pandarus, his own Brother dear,<br>
For love of God, full piteously did say,<br>
We must the Palace see of Cresida;                              <br>
For since we yet may have no other feast,<br>
Let us behold her Palace at the least!<br><br>

And therewithal to cover his intent<br>
A cause he found into the Town to go,<br>
And they right forth to Cresid's Palace went;                  <br>
But, Lord, this simple Troilus was woe,<br>
Him thought his sorrowful heart would break in two;<br>
For when he saw her doors fast bolted all,<br>
Well nigh for sorrow down he 'gan to fall.<br><br>

Therewith when this true Lover 'gan behold,                    <br>
How shut was every window of the place,<br>
Like frost he thought his heart was icy cold;<br>
For which, with chang&egrave;d, pale, and deadly face,<br>
Without word uttered, forth he 'gan to pace;<br>
And on his purpose bent so fast to ride,                       <br>
That no wight his continuance espied.<br><br>

Then said he thus,&mdash;O Palace desolate!<br>
O house of houses, once so richly dight!<br>
O Palace empty and disconsolate!<br>
Thou lamp of which extinguished is the light;                  <br>
O Palace whilom day that now art night,<br>
Thou ought'st to fall and I to die; since she<br>
Is gone who held us both in sovereignty.<br><br>

O, of all houses once the crown&egrave;d boast!<br>
Palace illumined with the sun of bliss;                        <br>
O ring of which the ruby now is lost,<br>
O cause of woe, that cause has been of bliss:<br>
Yet, since I may no better, would I kiss<br>
Thy cold doors; but I dare not for this rout;<br>
Farewell, thou shrine of which the Saint is out!<br><br>

Therewith he cast on Pandarus an eye,<br>
With changed face, and piteous to behold;<br>
And when he might his time aright espy,<br>
Aye as he rode, to Pandarus he told<br>
Both his new sorrow and his joys of old,                       <br>
So piteously, and with so dead a hue,<br>
That every wight might on his sorrow rue.<br><br>

Forth from the spot he rideth up and down,<br>
And everything to his rememberance<br>
Came as he rode by places of the town                          <br>
Where he had felt such perfect pleasure once.<br>
Lo, yonder saw I mine own Lady dance,<br>
And in that Temple she with her bright eyes,<br>
My Lady dear, first bound me captive-wise.<br><br>

And yonder with joy-smitten heart have I                       <br>
Heard my own Cresid's laugh; and once at play<br>
I yonder saw her eke full blissfully;<br>
And yonder once she unto me 'gan say&mdash;<br>
Now, my sweet Troilus, love me well, I pray!<br>
And there so graciously did me behold,                         <br>
That hers unto the death my heart I hold.<br><br>

And at the corner of that self-same house<br>
Heard I my most beloved Lady dear,<br>
So womanly, with voice melodious<br>
Singing so well, so goodly, and so clear,                      <br>
That in my soul methinks I yet do hear<br>
The blissful sound; and in that very place<br>
My Lady first me took unto her grace.<br><br>

O blissful God of Love! then thus he cried,<br>
When I the process have in memory,                             <br>
How thou hast wearied me on every side,<br>
Men thence a book might make, a history;<br>
What need to seek a conquest over me,<br>
Since I am wholly at thy will? what joy<br>
Hast thou thy own liege subjects to destroy?<br><br>

Dread Lord! so fearful when provoked, thine ire<br>
Well hast thou wreaked on me by pain and grief;<br>
Now mercy, Lord! thou know'st well I desire<br>
Thy grace above all pleasures first and chief;<br>
And live and die I will in thy belief;                         <br>
For which I ask for guerdon but one boon,<br>
That Cresida again thou send me soon.<br><br>

Constrain her heart as quickly to return,<br>
As thou dost mine with longing her to see,<br>
Then know I well that she would not sojourn.                   <br>
Now, blissful Lord, so cruel do not be<br>
Unto the blood of Troy, I pray of thee,<br>
As Juno was unto the Theban blood,<br>
From whence to Thebes came griefs in multitude.<br><br>

And after this he to the gate did go                           <br>
Whence Cresid rode, as if in haste she was;<br>
And up and down there went, and to and fro,<br>
And to himself full oft he said, alas!<br>
From hence my hope, and solace forth did pass.<br>
O would the blissful God now for his joy,                      <br>
I might her see again coming to Troy!<br><br>

And up to yonder hill was I her guide;<br>
Alas, and there I took of her my leave;<br>
Yonder I saw her to her Father ride,<br>
For very grief of which my heart shall cleave;&mdash;               <br>
And hither home I came when it was eve;<br>
And here I dwell an outcast from all joy,<br>
And shall, unless I see her soon in Troy.<br><br>

And of himself did he imagine oft,<br>
That he was blighted, pale, and waxen less                    <br>
Than he was wont; and that in whispers soft<br>
Men said, what may it be, can no one guess<br>
Why Troilus hath all this heaviness?<br>
All which he of himself conceited wholly<br>
Out of his weakness and his melancholy.<br><br>

Another time he took into his head,<br>
That every wight, who in the way passed by,<br>
Had of him ruth, and fancied that they said,<br>
I am right sorry Troilus will die:<br>
And thus a day or two drove wearily;                          <br>
As ye have heard; such life 'gan he to lead<br>
As one that standeth betwixt hope and dread.<br><br>

For which it pleased him in his songs to show<br>
The occasion of his woe, as best he might;<br>
And made a fitting song, of words but few,                <br>
Somewhat his woeful heart to make more light;<br>
And when he was removed from all men's sight,<br>
With a soft night voice, he of his Lady dear,<br>
That absent was, 'gan sing as ye may hear.<br><br>

O star, of which I lost have all the light,                   <br>
With a sore heart well ought I to bewail,<br>
That ever dark in torment, night by night,<br>
Toward my death with wind I steer and sail;<br>
For which upon the tenth night if thou fail<br>
With thy bright beams to guide me but one hour,               <br>
My ship and me Charybdis will devour.<br><br>

As soon as he this song had thus sung through,<br>
He fell again into his sorrows old;<br>
And every night, as was his wont to do,<br>
Troilus stood the bright moon to behold;                      <br>
And all his trouble to the moon he told,<br>
And said; I wis, when thou art horn'd anew,<br>
I shall be glad if all the world be true.<br><br>

Thy horns were old as now upon that morrow,<br>
When hence did journey my bright Lady dear,                   <br>
That cause is of my torment and my sorrow;<br>
For which, oh, gentle Luna, bright and clear,<br>
For love of God, run fast above thy sphere;<br>
For when thy horns begin once more to spring,<br>
Then shall she come, that with her bliss may bring. <br><br>

The day is more, and longer every night<br>
Than they were wont to be&mdash;for he thought so;<br>
And that the sun did take his course not right,<br>
By longer way than he was wont to go;<br>
And said, I am in constant dread I trow,                      <br>
That Ph&auml;eton his son is yet alive,<br>
His too fond father's car amiss to drive.<br><br>

Upon the walls fast also would he walk,<br>
To the end that he the Grecian host might see;<br>
And ever thus he to himself would talk:&mdash;                     <br>
Lo! yonder is my own bright Lady free;<br>
Or yonder is it that the tents must be;<br>
And thence does come this air which is so sweet,<br>
That in my soul I feel the joy of it.<br><br>

And certainly this wind, that more and more                   <br>
By moments thus increaseth in my face,<br>
Is of my Lady's sighs heavy and sore;<br>
I prove it thus; for in no other space<br>
Of all this town, save only in this place,<br>
Feel I a wind, that soundeth so like pain;                    <br>
It saith, Alas, why severed are we twain?<br><br>

A weary while in pain he tosseth thus,<br>
Till fully past and gone was the ninth night;<br>
And ever at his side stood Pandarus,<br>
Who busily made use of all his might                          <br>
To comfort him, and make his heart more light;<br>
Giving him always hope, that she the morrow<br>
Of the tenth day will come, and end his sorrow.<br>

<span style="color: #555555;">The Lyrical Ballads and Sonnets which follow were written
in 1802; but during that year Wordsworth continued mainly to
work at <i>The Excursion</i>, as the following extracts from his sister's
Journal indicate:</span>

  <blockquote>"Feb. 1, 1802.&mdash;William worked hard at <i>The Pedlar,</i> and tired
  himself.<br>
<br>
  2nd Feb.&mdash;Wm. worked at <i>The Pedlar</i>. I read aloud the 11th book of
  <i>Paradise Lost</i>.<br>
<br>
  Thursday, 4th.&mdash;William thought a little about <i>The Pedlar.</i><br>
<br>
  5th.&mdash;Wm. sate up late at <i>The Pedlar</i>.<br>
<br>
  7th.&mdash;W. was working at his poem. Wm. read <i>The Pedlar,</i> thinking it
  was done. But lo! ... it was uninteresting, and must be altered."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Similar records occur each day in the Journal from the 10th to the 14th
Feb. 1802.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<td>One morning (raw it was and wet&mdash;<br>
A foggy day in winter time)<br>
A Woman on the road I met,<br>
Not old, though something past her prime:<br>
Majestic in her person, tall and straight;<br>
And like a Roman matron's was her mien and gait.<br><br>

The ancient spirit is not dead;<br>
Old times, thought I, are breathing there;<br>
Proud was I that my country bred<br>
Such strength, a dignity so fair:<br>
She begged an alms, like one in poor estate;<br>
I looked at her again, nor did my pride abate.<br><br>

When from these lofty thoughts I woke,<br>
"What is it," said I, "that you bear,<br>
Beneath the covert of your Cloak,<br>
Protected from this cold damp air?"<br>
She answered, soon as she the question heard,<br>
"A simple burthen, Sir, a little Singing-bird."<br><br>

And, thus continuing, she said,<br>
"I had a Son, who many a day<br>
Sailed on the seas, but he is dead;<br>
In Denmark he was cast away:<br>
And I have travelled weary miles to see<br>
If aught which he had owned might still remain for me.<br><br>

"The bird and cage they both were his:<br>
'Twas my Son's bird; and neat and trim<br>
He kept it: many voyages<br>
The singing-bird had gone with him;<br>
When last he sailed, he left the bird behind;<br>
From bodings, as might be, that hung upon his mind.<br><br>

"He to a fellow-lodger's care<br>
Had left it, to be watched and fed,<br>
And pipe its song in safety;&mdash;there<br>
I found it when my Son was dead;<br>
And now, God help me for my little wit!<br>
I bear [8] it with me, Sir;&mdash;he took so much delight in it."<br>

<a href="#section60a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[Written to gratify Mr. Graham of Glasgow, brother of the author of <i>The
Sabbath</i>. He was a zealous coadjutor of Mr. Clarkson, and a man of
ardent humanity. The incident had happened to himself, and he urged me
to put it into verse, for humanity's sake. The humbleness, meanness if
you like, of the subject, together with the homely mode of treating it,
brought upon me a world of ridicule by the small critics, so that in
policy I excluded it from many editions of my poems, till it was
restored at the request of some of my friends, in particular my
son-in-law, Edward Quillinan.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">It was only excluded from the editions of 1820, 1827, and 1832. In the
edition of 1807 it was placed amongst a group of "Poems composed during
a Tour, chiefly on foot." In 1815, in 1836, and afterwards, it was
included in the group "referring to the Period of Childhood."<br>
<br>
In Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Grasmere Journal,</i> the following reference to
this poem occurs:</span>

  <blockquote>"Feb. 16, 1802.&mdash;Mr. Graham said he wished William had been with him
  the other day. He was riding in a post-chaise, and he heard a strange
  cry that he could not understand. The sound continued, and he called
  to the chaise-driver to stop. It was a little girl that was crying as
  if her heart would burst. She had got up behind the chaise, and her
  cloak had been caught by the wheel, and was jammed in, and it hung
  there. She was crying after it, poor thing. Mr. Graham took her into
  the chaise, and her cloak was released from the wheel, but the child's
  misery did not cease, for her cloak was torn to rags. It had been a
  miserable cloak before; but she had no other, and it was the greatest
  sorrow that could befall her. Her name was Alice Fell. She had no
  parents, and belonged to the next town. At the next town Mr. G. left
  money to buy her a new cloak."<br>
<br>
  "Friday (March 12).&mdash;In the evening after tea William wrote <i>Alice
  Fell</i>." <br>
<br>
"Saturday Morning (13th March).&mdash;William finished <i>Alice
  Fell</i>...."</blockquote>

<td>The post-boy drove with fierce career,<br>
For threatening clouds the moon had drowned;<br>
When, as we hurried on, my ear<br>
Was smitten with a startling sound.<br><br>

As if the wind blew many ways,<br>
I heard the sound,&mdash;and more and more;<br>
It seemed to follow with the chaise,<br>
And still I heard it as before.<br><br>

At length I to the boy called out;<br>
He stopped his horses at the word,<br>
But neither cry, nor voice, nor shout,<br>
Nor aught else like it, could be heard.<br><br>

The boy then smacked his whip, and fast<br>
The horses scampered through the rain;<br>
But, hearing soon upon the blast<br>
The cry, I bade him halt again.<br><br>

Forthwith alighting on the ground,<br>
"Whence comes," said I, "this piteous moan?"<br>
And there a little Girl I found,<br>
Sitting behind the chaise, alone.<br><br>

"My cloak!" no other word she spake,<br>
But loud and bitterly she wept,<br>
As if her innocent heart would break;<br>
And down from off her seat she leapt.<br><br>

"What ails you, child?"&mdash;she sobbed "Look here!"<br>
I saw it in the wheel entangled,<br>
A weather-beaten rag as e'er<br>
From any garden scare-crow dangled.<br><br>

There, twisted between nave and spoke,<br>
It hung, nor could at once be freed;<br>
But our joint pains unloosed the cloak,<br>
A miserable rag indeed!<br><br>

"And whither are you going, child,<br>
To-night along these lonesome ways?"<br>
"To Durham," answered she, half wild&mdash;<br>
"Then come with me into the chaise."<br><br>

Insensible to all relief<br>
Sat the poor girl, and forth did send<br>
Sob after sob, as if her grief<br>
Could never, never have an end.<br><br>

"My child, in Durham do you dwell?"<br>
She checked herself in her distress,<br>
And said, "My name is Alice Fell;<br>
I'm fatherless and motherless.<br><br>

"And I to Durham, Sir, belong."<br>
Again, as if the thought would choke<br>
Her very heart, her grief grew strong;<br>
And all was for her tattered cloak!<br><br>

The chaise drove on; our journey's end<br>
Was nigh; and, sitting by my side,<br>
As if she had lost her only friend<br>
She wept, nor would be pacified.<br><br>

Up to the tavern-door we post;<br>
Of Alice and her grief I told;<br>
And I gave money to the host,<br>
To buy a new cloak for the old.<br><br>

"And let it be of duffil grey,<br>
As warm a cloak as man can sell!"<br>
Proud creature was she the next day,<br>
The little orphan, Alice Fell!<br>

<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[<a name="fr61A">Written</a> at Town-end, Grasmere. Met, and described to me by my sister,
near the quarry at the head of Rydal Lake<a href="#61A"><sup>A</sup></a>, a place still a chosen
resort of vagrants travelling with their families.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">The following are Dorothy Wordsworth's references to this poem in her
Grasmere Journal. They justify the remark of the late Bishop of Lincoln,</span>

  <blockquote>"his poems are sometimes little more than poetical versions of her
  descriptions of the objects which she had seen, <i>and he treated them
  as seen by himself</i>."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">(See <i>Memoirs of Wordsworth</i>, vol. i. pp. 180-1.) </span>

 <blockquote> "Saturday (March 13, 1802).&mdash;William wrote the poem of the Beggar
  Woman, taken from a woman whom I had seen in May (now nearly two years
  ago), when John and he were at Gallow Hill. I sat with him at
  intervals all the morning, and took down his stanzas. After tea I read
  W. the account I had written of the little boy belonging to the tall
  woman: and an unlucky thing it was, for he could not escape from those
  very words, and so he could not write the poem. He left it unfinished,
  and went tired to bed. In our walk from Rydal he had got warmed with
  the subject, and had half cast the poem."<br>
<br>
  "Sunday Morning (March 14). &mdash;William had slept badly. He got up at 9
  o'clock, but before he rose he had finished the Beggar Boy." </blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The following is the "account" written in her <i>Journal</i> on Tuesday, May
23, 1800:</span>

  <blockquote>"A very tall woman, tall much beyond the measure of tall women, called
  at the door. She had on a very long brown cloak, and a very white cap,
  without bonnet. Her face was brown, but it had plainly once been fair.
  She led a little barefooted child about two years old by the hand, and
  said her husband, who was a tinker, was gone before with the other
  children. I gave her a piece of bread. Afterwards, on my road to
  Ambleside, beside the bridge at Rydal, I saw her husband sitting at
  the roadside, his two asses standing beside him, and the two young
  children at play upon the grass. The man did not beg. I passed on, and
  about a quarter of a mile farther I saw two boys before me, one about
  ten, the other about eight years old, at play, chasing a butterfly.
  They were wild figures, not very ragged, but without shoes and
  stockings. The hat of the elder was wreathed round with yellow
  flowers; the younger, whose hat was only a rimless crown, had stuck it
  round with laurel leaves. They continued at play till I drew very
  near, and then they addressed me with the begging cant and the whining
  voice of sorrow. I said, 'I served your mother this morning' (the boys
  were so like the woman who had called at our door that I could not be
  mistaken). 'O,' says the elder, 'you could not serve my mother, for
  she's dead, and my father's in at the next town; he's a potter.' I
  persisted in my assertion, and that I would give them nothing. Says
  the elder, 'Come, let's away,' and away they flew like lightning. They
  had, however, sauntered so long in their road that they did not reach
  Ambleside before me, and I saw them go up to Mathew Harrison's house
  with their wallet upon the elder's shoulder, and creeping with a
  beggar's complaining foot. On my return through Ambleside I met, in
  the street, the mother driving her asses, in the two panniers of one
  of which were the two little children, whom she was chiding and
  threatening with a wand with which she used to drive on her asses,
  while the little things hung in wantonness over the pannier's edge.
  The woman had told me in the morning that she was of Scotland, which
  her accent fully proved, and that she had lived (I think at Wigtown);
  that they could not keep a house, and so they travelled."</blockquote>

<td>She had a tall man's height or more;<br>
Her face from summer's noontide heat<br>
No bonnet shaded, but she wore<br>
A mantle, to her very feet<br>
Descending with a graceful flow, <br>
And on her head a cap as white as new-fallen snow.<br><br>

Her skin was of Egyptian brown:<br>
Haughty, as if her eye had seen<br>
Its own light to a distance thrown,<br>
She towered, fit person for a Queen<br>
To lead those ancient Amazonian files;<br>
Or ruling Bandit's wife among the Grecian isles.<br><br>

Advancing, forth she stretched her hand<br>
And begged an alms with doleful plea<br>
That ceased not; on our English land <br>
Such woes, I knew, could never be;<br>
And yet a boon I gave her, for the creature<br>
Was beautiful to see&mdash;a weed of glorious feature.<br><br>

I left her, and pursued my way;<br>
And soon before me did espy <br>
A pair of little Boys at play,<br>
Chasing a crimson butterfly;<br>
The taller followed with his hat in hand,<br>
Wreathed round with yellow flowers the gayest of the land.<br><br>

The other wore a rimless crown <br>
With leaves of laurel stuck about;<br>
And, while both followed up and down,<br>
Each whooping with a merry shout,<br>
In their fraternal features I could trace<br>
Unquestionable lines of that wild Suppliant's face. <br><br>

Yet <i>they</i>, so blithe of heart, seemed fit<br>
For finest tasks of earth or air:<br>
Wings let them have, and they might flit<br>
Precursors to Aurora's car,<br>
Scattering fresh flowers; though happier far, I ween, <br>
To hunt their fluttering game o'er rock and level green.<br><br>

They dart across my path&mdash;but lo, <br>
Each ready with a plaintive whine!<br>
Said I, "not half an hour ago<br>
Your Mother has had alms of mine."<br>
"That cannot be," one answered&mdash;"she is dead:"&mdash;<br>
I looked reproof&mdash;they saw&mdash;but neither hung his head.<br><br>

"She has been dead, Sir, many a day."&mdash;<br>
"Hush, boys! you're telling me a lie;<br>
It was your Mother, as I say!"<br>
And, in the twinkling of an eye,<br>
"Come! come!" cried one, and without more ado,<br>
Off to some other play the joyous Vagrants flew!<br>

of childhood spent at Cockermouth before 1778. "My sister
Emmeline" is Dorothy Wordsworth. In her <i>Grasmere Journal,</i>
of Sunday, March 14, 1802, the following occurs:</span>

  <blockquote>"While we were at breakfast he" (William) "wrote the poem <i>To a
  Butterfly</i>. He ate not a morsel, but sate with his shirt neck
  unbuttoned, and his waistcoat open when he did it. The thought first
  came upon him as we were talking about the pleasure we both always
  felt at the sight of a butterfly. I told him that I used to chase them
  a little, but that I was afraid of brushing the dust off their wings,
  and did not catch them. He told me how he used to kill all the white
  ones when he went to school, because they were Frenchmen. Mr. Simpson
  came in just as he was finishing the poem. After he was gone, I wrote
  it down, and the other poems, and I read them all over to him....
  William began to try to alter <i>The Butterfly</i>, and tired
  himself."</blockquote>

<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[Suggested by what I have noticed in more than one French fugitive

but in the Wordsworth circle, it was known from the year 1802 as <i>The
Emigrant Mother</i>, and at least one copy was transcribed with this
title in 1802. It was first published under that name in 1820. It was
revised and altered in 1820, 1827, 1832, 1836, and more especially in
1845.<br>
<br>
In Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal the following entries occur:</span>

 <blockquote> "Tuesday (March 16).&mdash;William went up into the orchard, and wrote a
  part of <i>The Emigrant Mother</i>."<br>
<br>
  "Wednesday.&mdash;William went up into the orchard, and finished the

  the orchard till dinner-time. He read me his poem."</blockquote>

I listened to; that Cry<br>
Which made me look a thousand ways<br>
In bush, and tree, and sky.<br><br>

To seek thee did I often rove<br>
Through woods and on the green;<br>
And thou wert still a hope, a love;<br>
Still longed for, never seen.<br><br>

And I can listen to thee yet;<br>
Can lie upon the plain<br>
And listen, till I do beget<br>
That golden time again.<br><br>

O blessed Bird! the earth we pace<br>
Again appears to be<br>
An unsubstantial, faery place;<br>
That is fit home for Thee!<br>

reading, and he agreed to restore that of 1820; saying, at the same

<a name="65n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">In the chronological lists of his poems, published in 1815 and 1820,
Wordsworth left a blank opposite this one, in the column containing the
year of composition. From 1836 to 1849, the date assigned by him was
1804. But in Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Journal</i> the following occurs under
date Tuesday, 22nd March 1802:</span>

 <blockquote> "A mild morning. William worked at the Cuckoo poem.... At the closing
  in of day, went to sit in the orchard. William came to me, and walked
  backwards and forwards. W. repeated the poem to me. I left him there;
  and in 20 minutes he came in, rather tired with attempting to write."<br>
<br>
  "Friday (March 25).&mdash;A beautiful morning. William worked at <i>The
  Cuckoo</i>." </blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">It is therefore evident that it belongs to the year 1802; although it
may have been altered and readjusted in 1804. The connection of the
seventh stanza of this poem with the first of that which follows it, "My
heart leaps up," etc., and of both with the <i>Ode, Intimations of
Immortality</i> (vol. viii.), is obvious.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<br>
  "May 14th.&mdash; ... William very nervous. After he was in bed, haunted

<span style="color: #555555;">(Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Grasmere Journal</i>.) This poem was known familiarly
in the household as "The Rainbow," although not printed under that
title. The text was never changed.<br>
<br>
In <i>The Friend</i>, vol. i. p. 58 (ed. 1818), Coleridge writes: </span>

  <blockquote>"Men laugh at the falsehoods imposed on them during their childhood,
  because they are not good and wise enough to contemplate the past in
  the present, and so to produce that continuity in their
  self-consciousness, which Nature has made the law of their animal
  life. Men are ungrateful to others, only when they have ceased to look
  back on their former selves with joy and tenderness. They exist in
  fragments." </blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">He then quotes the above poem, and adds:</span>

 <blockquote> "I am informed that these lines have been cited as a specimen of
  despicable puerility. So much the worse for the citer; not willingly
  in <i>his</i> presence would I behold the sun setting behind our
  mountains.... But let the dead bury their dead! The poet sang for the
  living.... I was always pleased with the motto placed under the figure
  of the rosemary in old herbals:

   <blockquote> 'Sus, apage! Haud tibi spiro.'"</blockquote></blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Compare the passage in <i>The Excursion</i> (book ix. l. 36) beginning:</span>

(as the title states), but on the 16th of April (Good Friday) 1802. The
bridge referred to crosses Goldrill Beck, a little below Hartsop in
Patterdale. The following, from Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Journal</i>, records
the walk from Ullswater, over Kirkstone Pass, to Ambleside:</span>

  <blockquote>"Friday, 16th April (Good Friday).&mdash;... When we came to the foot of
  Brothers Water, I left William sitting on the bridge, and went along
  the path on the right side of the lake through the wood. I was
  delighted with what I saw: the water under the boughs of the bare old
  trees, the simplicity of the mountains, and the exquisite beauty of
  the path. There was one grey cottage. I repeated <i>The Glowworm</i> as I
  walked along. I hung over the gate, and thought I could have stayed
  for ever. When I returned, I found William writing a poem descriptive
  of the sights and sounds we saw and heard. There was the gentle
  flowing of the stream, the glittering lively lake, green fields,
  without a living creature to be seen on them; behind us, a flat
  pasture with forty-two cattle feeding; to our left, the road leading
  to the hamlet. No smoke there, the sun shone on the bare roofs. The
  people were at work, ploughing, harrowing, and sowing; lasses working;
  a dog barking now and then; cocks crowing, birds twittering; the snow
  in patches at the top of the highest hills; yellow palms, purple and
  green twigs on the birches, ashes with their glittering stems quite
  bare. The hawthorn a bright green, with black stems under the oak. The
  moss of the oaks glossy.... As we went up the vale of Brothers Water,
  more and more cattle feeding, a hundred of them. William finished his
  poem before we got to the foot of Kirkstone. There were hundreds of
  cattle in the vale.... The walk up Kirkstone was very interesting. The
  becks among the rocks were all alive. William shewed me the little
  mossy streamlet which he had before loved, when he saw its bright
  green track in the snow. The view above Ambleside very beautiful.
  There we sate, and looked down on the green vale. We watched the crows
  at a little distance from us become white as silver, as they flew in
  the sunshine; and, when they went still farther, they looked like
  shapes of water passing over the green fields."</blockquote>

<a name="69n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">Wordsworth's date, as given to Miss Fenwick, is incorrect.
In her <i>Journal</i>, April 20, 1802, Dorothy Wordsworth
writes:</span>

  <blockquote>"William wrote a conclusion to the poem of <i>The Butterfly</i>, 'I've
  watch'd you now a full half-hour.'"</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">This, and the structure of the two poems, makes it probable that the
latter was originally meant to be a sort of conclusion to the <a href="#section63">former</a> (p.
283); but they were always printed as separate poems.<br>
<br>
Many of the "flowers" in the orchard at Dove Cottage were planted by
Dorothy Wordsworth, and some of the "trees" by William. The "summer
days" of childhood are referred to in <a href="#section63">the previous poem</a>, <i>To a
Butterfly</i>, written on the 14th of March 1802.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<a name="70n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">The full title of this poem, in the editions of 1807 to 1832, was
<i>Foresight, or the Charge of a Child to his younger Companion</i>, but it
was originally known in the household as "Children gathering Flowers."
The shortened title was adopted in 1836. The following is from Dorothy
Wordsworth's <i>Journal:</i></span>

  <blockquote>"Wednesday, 28th April (1802).&mdash;Copied the <i>Prioress's Tale</i>. William
  was in the orchard. I went to him; he worked away at his poem, though
  he was ill, and tired. I happened to say that when I was a child I
  would not have pulled a strawberry blossom; I left him, and wrote out
  the <i>Manciple's Tale</i>. At dinner time he came in with the poem of
  <i>Children gathering Flowers,</i> but it was not quite finished, and it
  kept him long from his dinner. It is now done. He is working at <i>The
  Tinker.</i>"</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">At an earlier date in the same year,&mdash;Jan. 31st, 1802,&mdash;the following
occurs:</span>

  <blockquote>"I found a strawberry blossom in a rock. The little slender flower had
  more courage than the green leaves, for <i>they</i> were but half expanded
  and half grown, but the blossom was spread full out. I uprooted it
  rashly, and I felt as if I had been committing an outrage; so I
  planted it again. It will have but a stormy life of it, but let it
  live if it can."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">With this poem compare a parallel passage in Marvel's <i>The Picture of T.
C. in a Prospect of Flowers</i>:</span>

 <blockquote> 'But oh, young beauty of the woods,<br>
  Whom nature courts with fruits and flowers,<br>
  Gather the flowers, but spare the buds;<br>
  Lest Flora, angry at thy crime<br>
  To kill her infants in their prime,<br>
  Should quickly make the example yours;<br>
  And, ere we see,<br>
  Nip in the blossom all our hopes in thee.'    </blockquote>

<a href="#section71a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[Written at Town-end, Grasmere. It is remarkable that this flower,
coming out so early in the spring as it does, and so bright and
beautiful, and in such profusion, should not have been noticed earlier
in English verse. What adds much to the interest that attends it is its
habit of shutting itself up and opening out according to the degree of
light and temperature of the air.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">One of the "Poems of the Fancy." In the original MS. this poem is called
<i>To the lesser Celandine</i>, but in the proof "small" was substituted for
"lesser."<br>
<br>
In Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Journal</i> the following occurs, under date April
30, 1802:</span>

  <blockquote>"We came into the orchard directly after breakfast, and sat there. The
  lake was calm, the sky cloudy. William began to write the poem of <i>The
  Celandine</i>.... I walked backwards and forwards with William. He
  repeated his poem to me, then he got to work again, and would not give
  over."</blockquote>

February last, my heart<br>

Celandine! and long ago,<br>
Praise of which I nothing know.<br><br>

I have not a doubt but he,<br>
Whosoe'er the man might be,<br>
Who the first with pointed rays<br>
(Workman worthy to be sainted)<br>
Set the sign-board in a blaze,<br>

News of winter's vanishing,<br>

All about with full-blown flowers,<br>
Thick as sheep in shepherd's fold!<br>
With the proudest thou art there,<br>
Mantling in the tiny square.<br><br>

Often have I sighed to measure<br>
By myself a lonely pleasure,<br>
Sighed to think, I read a book<br>
Only read, perhaps, by me;<br>
Yet I long could overlook<br>
Thy bright coronet and Thee,<br>
And thy arch and wily ways,<br>
And thy store of other praise.<br><br>

Blithe of heart, from week to week<br>
Thou dost play at hide-and-seek;<br>
While the patient primrose sits<br>
Like a beggar in the cold,<br>
Thou, a flower of wiser wits,<br>
Slip'st into thy sheltering hold;<br>
Liveliest of the vernal train<br>
When ye all are out again.<br><br>

Drawn by what peculiar spell,<br>
By what charm of sight or smell,<br>
Does the dim-eyed curious Bee,<br>
Labouring for her waxen cells,<br>
Fondly settle upon Thee<br>
Prized above all buds and bells<br>
Opening daily at thy side,<br>
By the season multiplied?<br><br>

Thou art not beyond the moon,<br>
But a thing "beneath our shoon:"<br>
Let the bold Discoverer thrid<br>
In his bark the polar sea;<br>
Rear who will a pyramid;<br>
Praise it is enough for me,<br>
If there be but three or four<br>
Who will love my little Flower.<br>

<td>Within our happy Castle there dwelt One<br>
Whom without blame I may not overlook;<br>
For never sun on living creature shone<br>
Who more devout enjoyment with us took:<br>
Here on his hours he hung as on a book,<br>
On his own time here would he float away,<br>
As doth a fly upon a summer brook;<br>
But go to-morrow, or belike to-day,<br>
Seek for him,&mdash;he is fled; and whither none can say.<br><br>

Thus often would he leave our peaceful home,<br>
And find elsewhere his business or delight;<br>
Out of our Valley's limits did he roam:<br>
Full many a time, upon a stormy night,<br>
His voice came to us from the neighbouring height:<br>
Oft could we see him driving full in view<br>
At midday when the sun was shining bright;<br>
What ill was on him, what he had to do,<br>
A mighty wonder bred among our quiet crew.<br><br>

Ah! piteous sight it was to see this Man<br>
When he came back to us, a withered flower,&mdash;<br>
Or like a sinful creature, pale and wan.<br>
Down would he sit; and without strength or power<br>
Look at the common grass from hour to hour:<br>
And oftentimes, how long I fear to say,<br>
Where apple-trees in blossom made a bower,<br>
Retired in that sunshiny shade he lay;<br>
And, like a naked Indian, slept himself away.<br><br>

Great wonder to our gentle tribe it was<br>
Whenever from our Valley he withdrew;<br>
For happier soul no living creature has<br>
Than he had, being here the long day through.<br>
Some thought he was a lover, and did woo:<br>
Some thought far worse of him, and judged him wrong;<br>
But verse was what he had been wedded to;<br>
And his own mind did like a tempest strong <br>
Come to him thus, and drove the weary Wight along.<br><br>

With him there often walked in friendly guise,<br>
Or lay upon the moss by brook or tree,<br>
A noticeable Man with large grey eyes,<br>
And a pale face that seemed undoubtedly<br>
As if a blooming face it ought to be;<br>
Heavy his low-hung lip did oft appear,<br>
Deprest by weight of musing Phantasy;<br>
Profound his forehead was, though not severe;<br>
Yet some did think that he had little business here:<br><br>

Sweet heaven forefend! his was a lawful right;<br>
Noisy he was, and gamesome as a boy;<br>
His limbs would toss about him with delight<br>
Like branches when strong winds the trees annoy.<br>
Nor lacked his calmer hours device or toy<br>
To banish listlessness and irksome care;<br>
He would have taught you how you might employ<br>
Yourself; and many did to him repair,&mdash;<br>
And certes not in vain; he had inventions rare.<br><br>

Expedients, too, of simplest sort he tried:<br>
Long blades of grass, plucked round him as he lay,<br>
Made, to his ear attentively applied,<br>
A pipe on which the wind would deftly play;<br>
Glasses he had, that little things display,<br>
The beetle panoplied in gems and gold,<br>
A mailed angel on a battle-day;<br>
The mysteries that cups of flowers enfold,<br>
And all the gorgeous sights which fairies do behold.<br><br>

He would entice that other Man to hear<br>
His music, and to view his imagery:<br>
And, sooth, these two were each to the other dear:<br>
No livelier love in such a place could be:<br>
There did they dwell-from earthly labour free,<br>
As happy spirits as were ever seen;<br>
If but a bird, to keep them company,<br>
Or butterfly sate down, they were, I ween,<br>
As pleased as if the same had been a Maiden-queen.<br>

between Beattie's description of <i>The Minstrel</i> and Wordsworth's account
of himself in this poem. It is somewhat curious that Dorothy Wordsworth,
writing to Miss Pollard from Forncett in 1793, quotes the line from <i>The
Minstrel</i>, book I. stanza 22, </span>

<blockquote>"In truth he was a strange and wayward wight," </blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">and adds</span>

<blockquote>"That verse of Beattie's <i>Minstrel</i> always reminds me
of him, and indeed the whole character of Edwin resembles much what
William was when I first knew him after leaving Halifax." </blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Mr. T.
Hutchinson called the attention of Professor Dowden to the same
resemblance between the two pictures. With lines 35, 36, compare in
Shelley's <i>Adonais</i>, stanza xxxi.:</span>

 <blockquote> 'And his own thoughts, along that rugged way,<br>
  Pursued, like raging hounds, their father and their prey.' </blockquote>

<a name="73n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">There can now be no doubt that, in the first four of these <i>Stanzas</i>,
Wordsworth refers to himself; and that, in the last four, he refers to
Coleridge. For a time it was uncertain whether in the earlier stanzas he
had Coleridge, or himself, in view; and whether, in the later ones, some
one else was, or was not, described. De Quincey, quoting (as he often
did) in random fashion, mixes up extracts from each set of the stanzas,
and applies them both to Coleridge; and Dorothy Wordsworth, in her
<i>Journal</i>, gives apparent (though only apparent) sanction to a reverse
order of allusion, by writing of "the stanzas about C. and himself" (her
brother). The following are her references to the poem in that <i>Journal:</i></span>

  <blockquote>"9th May (1802).-After tea he (W.) wrote two stanzas in the manner of
  Thomson's <i>Castle of Indolence</i>, and was tired out.<br>
<br>
  "10th May.&mdash;William still at work, though it is past ten o'clock ...
  William did not sleep till three o'clock."<br>
<br>
  "11th May.&mdash;William finished the stanzas about C. and himself. He did
  not go out to-day. ... He completely finished his poem. He went to bed
  at twelve o'clock." </blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">From these extracts two things are evident, </span>
<ol type="1">

  <li>who the persons are described in the stanzas, and </li>

  <li>the immense labour bestowed upon the poem.</li>
</ol>

<span style="color: #555555;">In the <i>Memoirs of Wordsworth</i>, by the late Bishop of Lincoln, there is
a passage (vol. ii. chap. li. p. 309) amongst the "Personal
Reminiscences, 1836," in which the Hon. Mr. Justice Coleridge virtually
decides the question of the identity of the two persons referred to, in
his record of a conversation with the poet. It is as follows:</span>

  <blockquote>"October 10th.&mdash;I have passed a great many hours to-day with
  Wordsworth in his home. I stumbled on him with proof sheets before
  him. He read me nearly all the sweet stanzas written in his copy of
  the <i>Castle of Indolence</i>, describing himself and my uncle; and he and
  Mrs. W. both assured me the description of the latter at that time was
  perfectly accurate; and he was almost as a great boy in feelings, and
  had all the tricks and fancies there described. Mrs. W. seemed to look
  back on him, and those times, with the fondest affection."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">I think "the neighbouring height" referred to is the height of White
Moss Common, behind the Fir-Grove, where Wordsworth was often heard
murmuring out his verses," booing" as the country folks said: and the</span>

   <blockquote> 'driving full in view<br>
  At midday when the sun was shining bright,'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">aptly describes his habits as recorded in his sister's <i>Journal</i>, and
elsewhere. The "withered flower," the "creature pale and wan," are
significant of those terrible reactions of spirit, which followed his
joyous hours of insight and inspiration. Stanzas IV. to VII. of
<i>Resolution and Independence</i> (p. 314), in which Wordsworth undoubtedly
described himself, may be compared with stanza III. of this poem. The
lines</span>

 <blockquote> 'Down would he sit; and without strength or power<br>
  Look at the common grass from hour to hour,'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">are aptly illustrated by such passages in his sister's <i>Journal</i>, as the
following, of 29th April 1802:</span>

  <blockquote>"We went to John's Grove, sate a while at first; afterwards William
  lay, and I lay in the trench, under the fence&mdash;he with his eyes
  closed, and listening to the waterfalls and the birds. There was no
  one waterfall above another&mdash;it was a kind of water in the air&mdash;the
  voice of the air. We were unseen by one another."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Again, April 23rd,</span>

 <blockquote> "Coleridge and I pushed on before. We left William sitting on the
  stones, feasting with silence."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">And this recalls the first verse of <i>Expostulation and Reply</i>, written
at Alfoxden in 1798;</span>

  <blockquote>Why, William, on that old grey stone,<br>
  Thus for the length of half a day,<br>
  Why, William, sit you thus alone,<br>
  And dream your time away?'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The retreat where "apple-trees in blossom made a bower," and where he so
often "slept himself away," was evidently the same as that described in
the poem <i>The Green Linnet</i>:</span>

  <blockquote>'Beneath these fruit-tree boughs that shed<br>
  Their snow white blossoms on my head.'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">On the other hand, the "low-hung lip" and "profound" forehead of the
other, the "noticeable Man with large grey eyes," mark him out as S. T.
C.; "the rapt One, of the god-like forehead," described in the
<i>Extempore Effusion upon the Death of James Hogg</i>. The description
"Noisy he was, and gamesome as a boy," is verified by what the poet and
his wife said to Mr. Justice Coleridge in 1836. In addition, Mr.
Hutchinson of Kimbolton tells me he "often heard his father say that
Coleridge was uproarious in his mirth."<br>
<br>
Matthew Arnold wrote me an interesting letter some years ago about these
stanzas, from which I make the following extract:</span>

 <blockquote> "When one looks uneasily at a poem it is easy to fidget oneself
  further, and neither the Wordsworth nor the Coleridge of our common
  notions seem to be exactly hit off in the <i>Stanzas</i>; still, I believe
  that the first described is Wordsworth and that the second described
  is Coleridge. I have myself heard Wordsworth speak of his prolonged
  exhausting wanderings among the hills. Then Miss Fenwick's notes show
  that Coleridge is certainly one of the two personages of the poem, and
  there are points in the description of the second man which suit him
  very well. The <i>profound forehead</i> is a touch akin to the <i>god-like
  forehead</i> in the mention of Coleridge in a later poem.<br>
<br>
  "I have a sort of recollection of having heard something about the
  <i>inventions rare,</i> and Coleridge is certain to have dabbled, at one
  time or other, in natural philosophy."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">In 1796 Coleridge wrote to his friend Cottle from Nether Stowey:</span>

 <blockquote> " ... I should not think of devoting less than 20 years to an Epic
  Poem: ten to collect materials and warm my mind with universal
  science. I would be a tolerable Mathematician, I would thoroughly know
  Mechanics, Hydrostatics, Optics, and Astronomy, Botany, Metallurgy,
  Fossilism, Chemistry, Geology, Anatomy, Medicine&mdash;then the <i>mind of
  man</i>&mdash;then the <i>minds of men</i>&mdash;in all Travels, Voyages, and Histories.
  So I would spend ten years&mdash;the next five to the composition of the
  poem&mdash;and the last five to the correction of it. So would I write,
  haply not unhearing of the divine and rightly whispering Voice," etc.</blockquote>

Mr. T. Hutchinson (Dublin) writes in <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i>, Dec. 15, 1894:

  <blockquote>"I take it for granted these lines were written, not only on the
  fly-leaf of Wordsworth's copy of the <i>Castle of Indolence</i>, but also
  by way of Supplement to that poem; i. e. as an <i>addendum</i> to the
  descriptive list of the denizens of the Castle given in stanzas
  LVII-LXIX of Canto I.; that, in short, they are meant to be read as
  though they were an after-thought of James Thomson's. Their author,
  therefore, has rightly imparted to them the curiously blended flavour
  of <i>romantic melancholy and slippered mirth,</i> of dreamlike vagueness
  and smiling hyperbole, which forms the distinctive mark of Thomson's
  poem; and thus the Poet and the Philosopher-Friend of Wordsworth's
  stanzas, like Thomson's companion sketches of the splenetic Solitary,
  the <i>bard more fat than bard beseems,</i> and the <i>little, round, fat,
  oily Man of God,</i> are neither more nor less than gentle caricatures."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">It has been suggested by Coleridge's grandson that Wordsworth was
describing S. T. C. in all the stanzas of this poem; that he drew two
separate pictures of him; in the first four stanzas a realistic
"character portrait," and in the last four a "companion picture,
figuring the outward semblance of Coleridge, but embodying
characteristics drawn from a third person"; so that we have a "fancy
sketch" mixed up with a real one. I cannot agree with this.  The
evidence against it is</span>
<ol type="1">
  <li>Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal; </li>
<li>  the poet's and his wife's remarks to Mr. Justice Coleridge; </li>
<li>  the fact that Wordsworth was not in the habit of "passing from
  realism into artistic composition," except where he distinctly
  indicated it, as in the case of the Hawkshead Schoolmaster, in the
  "Matthew" poems.  Such composite or conglomerate work was quite
  foreign to Wordsworth's genius.</li>

<a href="#section74a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[Written at Town-end, Grasmere. This old man I met a few hundred yards
from my cottage; and the account of him is taken from his own mouth. I
was in the state of feeling described in the beginning of the poem,
while crossing over Barton Fell from Mr. Clarkson's, at the foot of
Ullswater, towards Askham. The image of the hare I then observed on the
ridge of the Fell.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">This poem was known in the Wordsworth household as "The Leech-Gatherer,"
although it never received that name in print. An entry in Dorothy
Wordsworth's <i>Journal</i> of Friday, 3rd October 1800, may preface what she
wrote in 1802 about the composition of the poem.</span>

 <blockquote> "When William and I returned from accompanying Jones, we met an old
  man almost double. He had on a coat thrown over his shoulders above
  his waistcoat and coat. Under this he carried a bundle, and had an
  apron on, and a night-cap. His face was interesting. He had dark eyes,
  and a long nose. John, who afterwards met him at Wytheburn, took him
  for a Jew. He was of Scotch parents, but had been born in the army. He
  had had a wife, 'and a good woman, and it pleased God to bless him
  with ten children.' All these were dead but one, of whom he had not
  heard for many years, a sailor. His trade was to gather leeches; but
  now leeches were scarce, and he had not strength for it. He lived by
  begging, and was making his way to Carlisle where he would buy a few
  books to sell. He said leeches were very scarce, partly owing to this
  dry season; but many years they had been scarce. He supposed it was
  owing to their being much sought after; that they did not breed fast;
  and were of slow growth. Leeches were formerly 2s. 6d. the 100; now
  they were 30s. He had been hurt in driving a cart, his leg broken, his
  body driven over, his skull fractured. He felt no pain till he
  recovered from his first insensibility. It was late in the evening,
  when the light was just going away."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">It is most likely that this walk of William and Dorothy Wordsworth
"accompanying Jones," was on the day of Jones's departure from Dove
Cottage, viz. 26th September.<br>
<br>
The <i>Journal</i> continues:</span>

  <blockquote>"Tuesday, 4th May, 1802.&mdash;Though William went to bed nervous and jaded
  in the extreme, he rose refreshed. I wrote out <i>The Leech-Gatherer</i>
  for him, which he had begun the night before, and of which he wrote
  several stanzas in bed this morning...."<br>
<br>
  (They started to walk up the Raise to Wytheburn.)<br>
<br>
  "It was very hot; we rested several times by the way, read, and
  repeated <i>The Leech-Gatherer.</i>"<br>
<br>
  "Friday, 7th May.&mdash;William had slept uncommonly well, so, feeling
  himself strong, he fell to work at <i>The Leech-Gatherer</i>; he wrote hard
  at it till dinner time, then he gave over, tired to death&mdash;he had
  finished the poem."<br>
<br>
  "Sunday morning, 9th May.&mdash;William worked at <i>The Leech-Gatherer</i>
  almost incessantly from morning till tea-time. I copied <i>The
  Leech-Gatherer</i> and other poems for Coleridge. I was oppressed and
  sick at heart, for he wearied himself to death."<br>
<br>
  "Sunday, 4th July.&mdash;... William finished <i>The Leech-Gatherer</i> to-day."<br>
<br>
  "Monday, 5th July.&mdash;I copied out <i>The Leech-Gatherer</i> for Coleridge,
  and for us."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">From these extracts it is clear that Dorothy Wordsworth considered the
poem as "finished" on the 7th of May, and on the 9th she sent a copy to
Coleridge; but that it was not till the 4th of July that it was really
finished, and then a second copy was forwarded to Coleridge. It is
impossible to say from which of the two MSS. sent to him Coleridge
transcribed the copy which he forwarded to Sir George Beaumont. From
that copy of a copy (which is now amongst the Beaumont MSS. at
Coleorton) the various readings given, on Coleridge's authority, in the
notes to the poem, were obtained some years ago.<br>
<br>
The Fenwick note to the poem illustrates Wordsworth's habit of blending
in one description details which were originally separate, both as to
time and place. The scenery and the incidents of the poem are alike
composite. As he tells us that he met the leech-gatherer a few hundred
yards from Dove Cottage, the "lonely place" with its "pool, bare to the
eye of heaven," at once suggests White Moss Common and its small tarn;
but he adds that, in the opening stanzas of the poem, he is describing a
state of feeling he was in, when crossing the fells at the foot of
Ullswater to Askam, and that the image of the hare "running races in her
mirth," with the glittering mist accompanying her, was observed by him,
not on White Moss Common, but in one of the ridges of Moor Divock. To H.
C. Robinson he said of the "Leech-Gatherer" (Sept. 10, 1816), that "he
gave to his poetic character powers of mind which his original did not
possess." (Robinson's <i>Diary</i>, etc., vol. ii. p. 24.)<br>

in writing this stanza. I cannot agree with this. The value and interest
of the poem would be lessened by our imagining that Wordsworth's heart
never failed him; and that, when he appears to moralise at his own
expense, he was doing so at Coleridge's. Besides, the date of this poem,
taken in connection with entries in the Grasmere Journal of Dorothy
Wordsworth, makes it all but certain that Coleridge was not referred
to.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<a name="74n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">The <a name="fr74C">late</a> Bishop of Lincoln, in the <i>Memoirs</i> of his uncle (vol. i. pp.
172, 173), quotes from a letter, written by Wordsworth "to some friends,
which has much interest as bearing on this poem<a href="#74C"><sup>C</sup></a>. The following are
extracts from it:</span>

 <blockquote> "It is not a matter of indifference whether you are pleased with his
  figure and employment, it may be comparatively whether you are pleased
  with <i>this Poem</i>; but it is of the utmost importance that you should
  have had pleasure in contemplating the fortitude, independence,
  persevering spirit, and the general moral dignity of this old man's
  character." Again, "I will explain to you, in prose, my feelings in
  writing <i>that</i> poem.... I describe myself as having been exalted to
  the highest pitch of delight by the joyousness and beauty of nature;
  and then as depressed, even in the midst of those beautiful objects,
  to the lowest dejection and despair. A young poet in the midst of the
  happiness of nature is described as overwhelmed by the thoughts of the
  miserable reverses which have befallen the happiest of all men, viz.
  poets. I think of this till I am so deeply impressed with it, that I
  consider the manner in which I was rescued from my dejection and
  despair almost as an interposition of Providence. A person reading the
  poem with feelings like mine will have been awed and controlled,
  expecting something spiritual or supernatural. What is brought
  forward? A lonely place, 'a pond, by which an old man <i>was</i>, far from
  all house or home:' not <i>stood</i>, nor <i>sat</i>, but <i>was</i>&mdash;the figure
  presented in the most naked simplicity possible. This feeling of
  spirituality or supernaturalness is again referred to as being strong
  in my mind in this passage. How came he here? thought I, or what can
  he be doing? I then describe him, whether ill or well is not for me to
  judge with perfect confidence; but this I <i>can</i> confidently affirm,
  that though I believe God has given me a strong imagination, I cannot
  conceive a figure more impressive than that of an old man like this,
  the survivor of a wife and ten children, travelling alone among the
  mountains and all lonely places, carrying with him his own fortitude
  and the necessities which an unjust state of society has laid upon
  him. You speak of his speech as tedious. Every thing is tedious when
  one does not read with the feelings of the author. <i>The Thorn</i> is
  tedious to hundreds; and so is <i>The Idiot Boy</i> to hundreds. It is in
  the character of the old man to tell his story, which an impatient
  reader must feel tedious. But, good heavens! such a figure, in such a
  place; a pious, self-respecting, miserably infirm and pleased old man
  telling such a tale!"</blockquote>

occasions in these delightful volumes by the poet's nephew, the
reticence as to names&mdash;warrantable perhaps in 1851, so soon after the
poet's death&mdash;has now deprived the world of every means of knowing to
whom many of Wordsworth's letters were addressed. Professor Dowden asks
about it&mdash;and very naturally:</span>

  <blockquote>"Was it the letter to Mary and Sara" (Hutchinson) "about <i>The
  Leech-Gatherer,</i> mentioned in Dorothy's <i>Journal</i> of 14th June
  1802?"</blockquote>

<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[In the cottage of Town-end, one afternoon in 1801, my sister read to me
the sonnets of Milton. I had long been well acquainted with them, but I
was particularly struck on that occasion with the dignified simplicity
and majestic harmony that runs through most of them&mdash;in character so
totally different from the Italian, and still more so from Shakespeare's
fine sonnets. I took fire, if I may be allowed to say so, and produced
three sonnets the same afternoon, the first I ever wrote, except an
irregular one at school. Of these three the only one I distinctly
remember is 'I grieved for Buonapart&eacute;, etc.'; one of the others was
never written down; the third, which was I believe preserved, I cannot
particularise.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>

<td>Farewell, thou little Nook of mountain-ground,<br>
Thou rocky corner in the lowest stair<br>
Of that magnificent temple which doth bound<br>
One side of our whole vale with grandeur rare;<br>
Sweet garden-orchard, eminently fair,<br>
The loveliest spot that man hath ever found,<br>
Farewell!&mdash;we leave thee to Heaven's peaceful care,<br>
Thee, and the Cottage which thou dost surround.<br><br>

Our boat is safely anchored by the shore,<br>
And there will safely ride when we are gone;<br>
The flowering shrubs that deck our humble door<br>
Will prosper, though untended and alone:<br>
Fields, goods, and far-off chattels we have none:<br>
These narrow bounds contain our private store<br>
Of things earth makes, and sun doth shine upon;<br>
Here are they in our sight&mdash;we have no more.<br><br>

Sunshine and shower be with you, bud and bell!<br>
For two months now in vain we shall be sought;<br>
We leave you here in solitude to dwell<br>
With these our latest gifts of tender thought;<br>
Thou, like the morning, in thy saffron coat,<br>
Bright gowan, and marsh-marigold, farewell!<br>
Whom from the borders of the Lake we brought,<br>
And placed together near our rocky Well.<br><br>

We go for One to whom ye will be dear;<br>
And she will prize this Bower, this Indian shed,<br>
Our own contrivance, Building without peer!<br>
&mdash;A gentle Maid, whose heart is lowly bred,<br>
Whose pleasures are in wild fields gathered,<br>
With joyousness, and with a thoughtful cheer,<br>
Will come to you; to you herself will wed;<br>
And love the blessed life that we lead here.<br><br>

Dear Spot! which we have watched with tender heed,<br>
Bringing thee chosen plants and blossoms blown<br>
Among the distant mountains, flower and weed,<br>
Which thou hast taken to thee as thy own.<br>
Making all kindness registered and known;<br>
Thou for our sakes, though Nature's child indeed,<br>
Fair in thyself and beautiful alone,<br>
Hast taken gifts which thou dost little need.<br><br>

And O most constant, yet most fickle Place,<br>
That hast thy wayward moods, as thou dost show<br>
To them who look not daily on thy face;<br>
Who, being loved, in love no bounds dost know,<br>
And say'st, when we forsake thee, "Let them go!"<br>
Thou easy-hearted Thing, with thy wild race<br>
Of weeds and flowers, till we return be slow,<br>
And travel with the year at a soft pace.<br><br>

Help us to tell Her tales of years gone by,<br>
And this sweet spring, the best beloved and best;<br>
Joy will be flown in its mortality;<br>
Something must stay to tell us of the rest.<br>
Here, thronged with primroses, the steep rock's breast<br>
Glittered at evening like a starry sky;<br>
And in this bush our sparrow built her nest,<br>
Of which I sang one song that will not die.<br><br>

O happy Garden! whose seclusion deep<br>
Hath been so friendly to industrious hours;<br>
And to soft slumbers, that did gently steep<br>
Our spirits, carrying with them dreams of flowers,<br>
And wild notes warbled among leafy bowers;<br>
Two burning months let summer overleap,<br>
And, coming back with Her who will be ours,<br>
Into thy bosom we again shall creep.<br>

<a name="78n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">The date which Wordsworth gave to this sonnet on its first publication
in 1807, viz. September 3, 1803,&mdash;and which he retained in all
subsequent editions of his works till 1836,&mdash;is inaccurate. He left
London for Dover, on his way to Calais, on the 31st of July 1802. The
sonnet was written that morning as he travelled towards Dover. The
following record of the journey is preserved in his sister's <i>Journal:</i></span>

<blockquote>  "<a name="fr78A">July</a> 30.<a href="#78A"><sup>A</sup></a>&mdash;Left London between five and six o'clock of the morning
  outside the Dover coach. A beautiful morning. The city, St. Paul's,
  with the river&mdash;a multitude of little boats, made a beautiful sight as
  we crossed <i>Westminster Bridge</i>; the houses not overhung by their
  clouds of smoke, and were hung out endlessly; yet the sun shone so
  brightly, with such a pure light, that there was something like the
  purity of one of Nature's own grand spectacles."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">This sonnet underwent no change in successive editions.<br>
<br>
In illustration of it, an anecdote of the late Bishop of St. David's may
be given, as reported by Lord Coleridge.</span>

 <blockquote> "In the great debate on the abolition of the Irish Establishment in
  1869, the Bishop of St. David's, Dr. Thirlwall, had made a very
  remarkable speech, and had been kept till past daybreak in the House
  of Lords, before the division was over, and he was able to walk home.
  He was then an old man, and in failing health. Some time after, he was
  asked whether he had not run some risk to his health, and whether he
  did not feel much exhausted. 'Yes,' he said, 'perhaps so; but I was
  more than repaid by walking out upon Westminster Bridge after the
  division, seeing London in the morning light as Wordsworth saw it, and
  repeating to myself his noble sonnet as I walked home.'"</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">This anecdote was told to the Wordsworth Society, at its meeting on the
3rd of May 1882, after a letter had been read by the Secretary, from Mr.
Robert Spence Watson, recording the following similar experience:</span>

  <blockquote>"... As confirming the perfect truth of Wordsworth's description of
  the external aspects of a scene, and the way in which he reached its
  inmost soul, I may tell you what happened to me, and may have happened
  to many others. Many years ago, I think it was in 1859, I chanced to
  be passing (in a pained and depressed state of mind, occasioned by the
  death of a friend) over Waterloo Bridge at half-past three on a lovely
  June morning. It was broad daylight, and I was alone. Never when alone
  in the remotest recesses of the Alps, with nothing around me but the
  mountains, or upon the plains of Africa, alone with the wonderful
  glory of the southern night, have I seen anything to approach the
  solemnity&mdash;the soothing solemnity&mdash;of the city, sleeping under the
  early sun:

   <blockquote> 'Earth has not any thing to show more fair.'</blockquote>

  "How simply, yet how perfectly, Wordsworth has interpreted it! It was
  a happy thing for us that the Dover coach left at so untimely an hour.
  It was this sonnet, I think, that first opened my eyes to Wordsworth's
  greatness as a poet. Perhaps nothing that he has written shows more
  strikingly the vast sympathy which is his peculiar dower."

Wordsworth's residence at Calais, in the month of August, 1802. The
following extract from his sister's Journal illustrates it:</span>

  <blockquote>"We arrived at <i>Calais</i> at four o'clock on Sunday morning the 31st of
  July. We had delightful walks after the heat of the day was
  passed&mdash;seeing far off in the west the coast of England, like a cloud,
  crested with Dover Castle, the evening Star, and the glory of the sky;
  the reflections in the water were more beautiful than the sky itself;
  purple waves brighter than precious stones, for ever melting away upon

<a name="81n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">This sonnet, originally entitled <i>To a Friend, composed near Calais, on
the Road leading to Ardres, August 7th, 1802</i>, was addressed to Robert
Jones, of Plas-yn-llan, near Ruthin, Denbighshire, a brother collegian
at Cambridge, and afterwards a fellow of St. John's College, and
incumbent of Soulderne, near Deddington, in Oxfordshire. It was to him
that Wordsworth dedicated his <i>Descriptive Sketches</i>, which record their
wanderings together in Switzerland; and it is to the pedestrian tour,
undertaken by the two friends in the long vacation of 1790, that he
refers in the above sonnet. The character of Jones is sketched in the
poem written in 1800, beginning:</span>

   <blockquote><a name="fr81C"></a> 'I marvel how Nature could ever find space,'<a href="#81C"><sup>C</sup></a></blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">and his parsonage in Oxfordshire is described in the sonnet:</span>

    <blockquote>'Where holy ground begins, unhallowed ends,<br>
    Is marked by no distinguishable line.'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The following note on Jones was appended to the edition of
1837:</span>

 <blockquote> "This excellent Person, one of my earliest and dearest friends, died
  in the year 1835. We were under-graduates together of the same year,
  at the same college; and companions in many a delightful ramble
  through his own romantic Country of North Wales. Much of the latter
  part of his life he passed in comparative solitude; which I know was
  often cheered by remembrance of our youthful adventures, and of the
  beautiful regions which, at home and abroad, we had visited together.
  Our long friendship was never subject to a moment's
  interruption,&mdash;and, while revising these volumes for the last time, I
  have been so often reminded of my loss, with a not unpleasing sadness,
  that I trust the Reader will excuse this passing mention of a Man who
  well deserves from me something more than so brief a notice. Let me
  only add, that during the middle part of his life he resided many
  years (as Incumbent of the Living) at a Parsonage in Oxfordshire,
  which is the subject of one of the <i>Miscellaneous Sonnets.</i>"</blockquote>

<a name="83A"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote A:</span></a> &nbsp;<span style="color: #555555;"> I thought, for some time, that the "girl" referred to was
Dorothy Wordsworth. Her brother used to speak, and to write, of her
under many names, "Emily," "Louisa," etc.; and to call her a "child" in
1802&mdash;a "child of Nature" she was to the end of her days&mdash;or a "girl,"
seemed quite natural. However, a more probable suggestion was made by
Mr. T. Hutchinson to Professor Dowden, that it refers to the girl
Caroline mentioned in Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Journal.</i> </span>

  <blockquote>"We arrived at Calais at four o'clock on Sunday morning, the 3rd of
  July.... We found out Annette and C., chez Madame Avril dans la rue de
  la T&ecirc;te d'or. The weather was very hot. We walked by the shore almost
  every evening with Annette and Caroline, or William and I alone.... It
  was beautiful on the calm hot night to see the little boats row out of
  harbour with wings of fire, and the sail-boats with the fiery track
  which they cut as they went along, and which closed up after them with
  a hundred thousand sparkles and streams of glowworm light. Caroline
  was delighted."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">I have been unable to discover who Annette and Caroline were. Dorothy
Wordsworth frequently records in her Grasmere Journal that either
William, or she, "wrote to Annette," but who she was is unknown to
either the Wordsworth or the Hutchinson family. &mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<blockquote>"Once did She hold the gorgeous east in fee."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The special glory of Venice dates from the conquest of Constantinople by
the Latins in 1202. The fourth Crusade&mdash;in which the French and
Venetians alone took part&mdash;started from Venice, in October 1202, under
the command of the Doge, Henry Dandolo. Its aim, however, was not the
recovery of Palestine, but the conquest of Constantinople. At the close
of the crusade, Venice received the Morea, part of Thessaly, the
Cyclades, many of the Byzantine cities, and the coasts of the
Hellespont, with three-eighths of the city of Constantinople itself, the
Doge taking the curious title of Duke of three-eighths of the Roman
Empire.</span>

 <blockquote> "And was the safeguard of the west."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">This may refer to the prominent part which Venice took in the Crusades,
or to the development of her naval power, which made her mistress of the
Mediterranean for many years, and an effective bulwark against invasions
from the East.</span>

  <blockquote>"The eldest Child of Liberty."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The origin of the Venetian State was the flight of many of
the inhabitants of the mainland&mdash;on the invasion of Italy by
Attila&mdash;to the chain of islands that lie at the head of the
Adriatic. </span>

 <blockquote> "In the midst of the waters, free, indigent, laborious, and
  inaccessible, they gradually coalesced into a republic: the first
  foundations of Venice were laid in the island of Rialto.... On the
  verge of the two empires the Venetians exult in the belief of
  primitive and perpetual independence."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Gibbon's <i>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>, chap. lx.</span>

 <blockquote> "And, when she took unto herself a Mate,<br>
  She must espouse the everlasting Sea."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">In 1177, Pope Alexander III. appealed to the Venetian Republic for
protection against the German Emperor. The Venetians were successful in
a naval battle at Saboro, against Otho, the son of Frederick Barbarossa.
In return, the Pope presented the Doge Liani with a ring, with which he
told him to wed the Adriatic, that posterity might know that the sea was
subject to Venice, "as a bride is to her husband."<br>
<br>
In September 1796, nearly six years before this sonnet was written, the
fate of the old Venetian Republic was sealed by the treaty of Campo
Formio. The French army under Napoleon had subdued Italy, and, having
crossed the Alps, threatened Vienna. To avert impending disaster, the
Emperor Francis arranged a treaty which extinguished the Venetian
Republic. He divided its territory between himself and Napoleon, Austria
retaining Istria, Dalmatia, and the left bank of the Adige in the
Venetian State, with the "maiden city" itself; France receiving the rest
of the territory and the Ionian Islands. Since the date of that treaty
the city has twice been annexed to Italy.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<a name="85n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">The following is Wordsworth's note to this sonnet, added in 1837:</span>

 <blockquote> "In this and a succeeding Sonnet on the same subject, let me be
  understood as a Poet availing himself of the situation which the King
  of Sweden occupied, and of the principles <b>Avowed in His Manifestos</b>; as
  laying hold of these advantages for the purpose of embodying moral
  truths. This <a name="fr85A">remark</a> might, perhaps, as well have been suppressed; for
  to those who may be in sympathy with the course of these Poems, it
  will be superfluous; and will, I fear, be thrown away upon that other
  class, whose besotted admiration of the intoxicated despot hereafter
  placed<a href="#85A"><sup>A</sup></a> in contrast with him, is the most melancholy evidence of
  degradation in British feeling and intellect which the times have
  furnished."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The king referred to is Gustavus IV., who was born in 1778, proclaimed
king in 1792, and died in 1837. His first public act after his accession
was to join in the coalition against Napoleon, and dislike of Napoleon
was the main-spring of his policy. It is to this that Wordsworth refers
in the sonnet:</span>

  <blockquote>'... the illustrious Swede hath done<br>
  The thing which ought to be ...'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">It made him unpopular, however, and gave rise to a conspiracy against
him, and to his consequent abdication in 1809. He "died forgotten and in
poverty."&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<a name="86n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp;<span style="color: #555555;"> Fran&ccedil;ois Dominique Toussaint (who was surnamed L'Ouverture), the child
of African slaves, was born at St. Domingo in 1743. He was a Royalist in
political sympathy till 1794, when the decree of the French convention,
giving liberty to the slaves, brought him over to the side of the
Republic. He was made a general of division by Laveux, and succeeded in
taking the whole of the north of the island from the English. In 1796 he
was made chief of the French army of St. Domingo, and first the British
commander, and next the Spanish, surrendered everything to him. He
became governor of the island, which prospered under his rule. Napoleon,
however, in 1801, issued an edict re-establishing slavery in St.
Domingo. Toussaint professed obedience, but showed that he meant to
resist the edict. A fleet of fifty-four vessels was sent from France to
enforce it. Toussaint was proclaimed an outlaw. He surrendered, and was
received with military honours, but was treacherously arrested and sent
to Paris in June 1802, where he died, in April 1803, after ten months'
hardship in prison. He had been two months in prison when Wordsworth
addressed this sonnet to him.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

Even so doth God protect us if we be<br>
Virtuous and wise. Winds blow, and waters roll, <br>
Strength to the brave, and Power, and Deity;<br>
Yet in themselves are nothing! One decree<br>
Spake laws to <i>them</i>, and said that by the soul<br>
Only, the Nations shall be great and free.<br>

  <span style="color: #555555;">"The narrow seas that form our boundaries, what were they in times of
  old? The convenient highway for Danish and Norman pirates. What are
  they now? Still, but a 'Span of Waters.' Yet they roll at the base of

  rested!"</span>

we be."<br>
<br>
The <a href="#87n1">note</a> appended to the sonnet, <i>Composed in the Valley near Dover,
on the day of Landing</i> (p. 341), shows that this one refers to the
same occasion; and that while "Inland, within a hollow vale," Wordsworth
was, at the same time, on the Dover Cliffs; the "vale" being one of the
hollow clefts in the headland, which front the Dover coast-line. The
sonnet may, however, have been finished afterwards in London.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<h4>Composed September, 1802.&mdash;Published 1807</h4>

<a href="#section90a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[This was written immediately after my return from France to London,
when I could not but be struck, as here described, with the vanity and
parade of our own country, especially in great towns and cities, as
contrasted with the quiet, and I may say the desolation, that the
Revolution had produced in France. This must be borne in mind, or else
the reader may think that in this and the succeeding Sonnets I have
exaggerated the mischief engendered and fostered among us by undisturbed
wealth. It would not be easy to conceive with what a depth of feeling I
entered into the struggle carried on by the Spaniards for their
deliverance from the usurped power of the French. Many times have I gone
from Allan Bank in Grasmere Vale, where we were then residing, to the
top of Raise-gap, as it is called, so late as two o'clock in the
morning, to meet the carrier bringing the newspapers from Keswick.
Imperfect traces of the state of mind in which I then was may be found
in my tract on the Convention of Cintra, as well as in these
Sonnets.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>

<span style="color: #663300;">[Composed October 4th, 1802, after a journey over the Hambleton Hills,
on a day memorable to me&mdash;the day of my marriage. The horizon commanded
by those hills is most magnificent. The next day, while we were
travelling in a post-chaise up Wensleydale, we were stopped by one of
the horses proving restive, and were obliged to wait two hours in a
severe storm before the post-boy could fetch from the inn another to
supply its place. The spot was in front of Bolton Hall, where Mary Queen
of Scots was kept prisoner, soon after her unfortunate landing at
Workington. The place then belonged to the Scroops, and memorials of her
are yet preserved there. To beguile the time I composed a Sonnet. The
subject was our own confinement contrasted with hers; but it was not
thought worthy of being preserved.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>

<td>Dark and more dark the shades of evening fell;<br>
The wished-for point was reached&mdash;but at an hour<br>
When little could be gained from that rich dower<br>
Of prospect, whereof many thousands tell.<br>
Yet did the glowing west with marvellous power <br>
Salute us; there stood Indian citadel,<br>
Temple of Greece, and minster with its tower<br>
Substantially expressed&mdash;a place for bell<br>
Or clock to toll from! Many a tempting isle,<br>
With groves that never were imagined, lay <br>
'Mid seas how steadfast! objects all for the eye<br>
Of silent rapture; but we felt the while<br>
We should forget them; they are of the sky,<br>
And from our earthly memory fade away.<br>

<a name="95n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp;<span style="color: #555555;"> The following extract from Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal indicates, as
fully as any other passage in it, the use which her brother occasionally
made of it. We have the "Grecian Temple," and the "Minster with its
Tower":</span>

 <blockquote> "Before we had crossed the Hambleton Hill and reached the point
  overlooking Yorkshire it was quite dark. We had not wanted, however,
  fair prospects before us, as we drove along the flat plain of the high
  hill; far, far off from us, in the western sky, we saw shapes of
  castles, ruins among groves&mdash;a great, spreading wood, rocks, and
  single trees&mdash;a Minster with its Tower unusually distinct, Minarets in
  another quarter, and a round Grecian Temple also; the colours of the
  sky of a bright grey, and the forms of a sober grey, with a dome. As
  we descended the hill there was no distinct view, but of a great
  space, only near us, we saw the wild (and as the people say)
  bottomless Tarn in the hollow at the side of the hill. It seemed to be
  made visible to us only by its own light, for all the hill about us
  was dark."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Wordsworth and his sister crossed over the Hambleton (or Hamilton)
Hills, on their way from Westmoreland to Gallow Hill, Yorkshire, to
visit the Hutchinsons, before they went south to London and Calais,
where they spent the month of August, 1802. But after his marriage to
Mary Hutchinson, on the 4th of October, Wordsworth, his wife, and
sister, recrossed these Hambleton Hills on their way to Grasmere, which
they reached on the evening of the 6th October. The above sonnet was
composed on the evening of the 4th October, as the Fenwick note
indicates.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<td>O thou! whose fancies from afar are brought;<br>
Who of thy words dost make a mock apparel,<br>
And fittest to unutterable thought<br>
The breeze-like motion and the self-born carol;<br>
Thou faery voyager! that dost float<br>
In such clear water, that thy boat<br>
May rather seem<br>
To brood on air than on an earthly stream;<br>
Suspended in a stream as clear as sky,<br>
Where earth and heaven do make one imagery;<br>
O blessed vision! happy child!<br>
Thou art so exquisitely wild,<br>
I think of thee with many fears<br>
For what may be thy lot in future years.<br>
  <br>
I thought of times when Pain might be thy guest,<br>
Lord of thy house and hospitality;<br>
And Grief, uneasy lover! never rest<br>
But when she sate within the touch of thee.<br>
O too industrious folly!<br>
O vain and causeless melancholy!<br>
Nature will either end thee quite;<br>
Or, lengthening out thy season of delight,<br>
Preserve for thee, by individual right,<br>
A young lamb's heart among the full-grown flocks.<br>
What hast thou to do with sorrow,<br>
Or the injuries of to-morrow?<br>
Thou art a dew-drop, which the morn brings forth,<br>
Ill fitted to sustain unkindly shocks,<br>
Or to be trailed along the soiling earth;<br>
A gem that glitters while it lives,<br>
And no forewarning gives;<br>
But, at the touch of wrong, without a strife<br>
Slips in a moment out of life.

sad "presentiment" with which the <i>Lines composed above Tintern Abbey</i>
conclude. The following is the postscript to a letter by his father, S.
T. C., addressed to Sir Humphry Davy, Keswick, July 25, 1800:</span>

  <blockquote>"Hartley is a spirit that dances on an aspen leaf; the air that yonder
  sallow-faced and yawning tourist is breathing, is to my babe a
  perpetual nitrous oxide. Never was more joyous creature born. Pain
  with him is so wholly trans-substantiated by the joys that had rolled
  on before, and rushed on after, that oftentimes five minutes after his
  mother has whipt him he has gone up and asked her to whip him again."</blockquote>

<td>In youth from rock to rock I went,<br>
From hill to hill in discontent<br>
Of pleasure high and turbulent,<br>
    Most pleased when most uneasy;<br>
But now my own delights I make,&mdash;<br>
My thirst at every rill can slake,<br>
And gladly Nature's love partake,<br>
    Of Thee, sweet Daisy!<br>
    <br>
Thee Winter in the garland wears<br>
That thinly decks his few grey hairs;<br>
Spring parts the clouds with softest airs,<br>
  That she may sun thee;<br>
Whole Summer-fields are thine by right;<br>
And Autumn, melancholy Wight!<br>
Doth in thy crimson head delight<br>
  When rains are on thee.<br><br>

In shoals and bands, a morrice train,<br>
Thou greet'st the traveller in the lane;<br>
Pleased at his greeting thee again;<br>
  Yet nothing daunted, <br>
Nor grieved if thou be set at nought:<br>
And oft alone in nooks remote<br>
We meet thee, like a pleasant thought,<br>
  When such are wanted.<br><br>

Be violets in their secret mews <br>
The flowers the wanton Zephyrs choose;<br>
Proud be the rose, with rains and dews<br>
  Her head impearling,<br>
Thou liv'st with less ambitious aim,<br>
Yet hast not gone without thy fame;<br>
Thou art indeed by many a claim<br>
    The Poet's darling.<br><br>

If to a rock from rains he fly,<br>
Or, some bright day of April sky,<br>
Imprisoned by hot sunshine lie <br>
    Near the green holly,<br>
And wearily at length should fare;<br>
He needs but look about, and there<br>
Thou art!&mdash;a friend at hand, to scare<br>
    His melancholy.<br><br>

A hundred times, by rock or bower,<br>
Ere thus I have lain couched an hour,<br>
Have I derived from thy sweet power<br>
    Some apprehension;<br>
Some steady love; some brief delight;<br>
Some memory that had taken flight;<br>
Some chime of fancy wrong or right;<br>
    Or stray invention.<br><br>

If stately passions in me burn,<br>
And one chance look to Thee should turn,<br>
I drink out of an humbler urn<br>
    A lowlier pleasure;<br>
The homely sympathy that heeds<br>
The common life, our nature breeds;<br>
A wisdom fitted to the needs<br>
    Of hearts at leisure.<br><br>

Fresh-smitten by the morning ray,<br>
When thou art up, alert and gay,<br>
Then, cheerful Flower! my spirits play<br>
    With kindred gladness:<br>
And when, at dusk, by dews opprest<br>
Thou sink'st, the image of thy rest<br>
Hath often eased my pensive breast<br>
    Of careful sadness.<br><br>

And all day long I number yet,<br>
All seasons through, another debt,<br>
Which I, wherever thou art met,<br>
    To thee am owing;<br>
 An instinct call it, a blind sense;<br>
A happy, genial influence,<br>
Coming one knows not how, nor whence,<br>
    Nor whither going.<br><br>

Child of the Year! that round dost run<br>
Thy pleasant course,&mdash;when day's begun<br>
As ready to salute the sun<br>
    As lark or leveret,<br>
Thy long-lost praise thou shalt regain;<br>
Nor be less dear to future men<br>
Than in old time;&mdash;thou not in vain<br>
    Art Nature's favourite.<br>

poems. It may be as well to note that his quotation was erroneous in two

<a name="98C"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote C:</span></a> &nbsp; This Poem, and two others to the same Flower, which the
Reader will find in the second Volume, were written in the year 1802;
which is mentioned, because in some of the ideas, though not in the
manner in which those ideas are connected, and likewise even in some of
the expressions, they bear a striking resemblance to a Poem (lately
published) of Mr. Montgomery, entitled, <i>A Field Flower</i>. This
being said, Mr. Montgomery will not think any apology due to him; I
cannot however help addressing him in the words of the Father of English
Poets:

 <blockquote> 'Though it happe me to rehersin&mdash;<br>
  That ye han in your freshe songis saied,<br>
  Forberith me, and beth not ill apaied,<br>
  Sith that ye se I doe it in the honour<br>
  Of Love, and eke in service of the Flour.'</blockquote>

W. W. 1807.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">In the edition of 1836, the following variation of the text of this note
occurs: "There is a resemblance to passages in a Poem."&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<a name="98n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">For illustration of the last stanza, see Chaucer's Prologue to <i>The
Legend of Good Women</i>.</span>

 <blockquote> 'As I seyde erst, whanne comen is the May,<br>
  That in my bed ther daweth me no day,<br>
  That I nam uppe and walkyng in the mede,<br>
  To seen this floure agein the sonne sprede,<br>
  Whan it up rysith erly by the morwe;<br>
  That blisful sight softneth al my sorwe,<br>
  So glad am I, whan that I have presence<br>
  Of it, to doon it alle reverence,<br>
  As she that is of alle floures flour.'<br>
  ...<br>
  To seen this flour so yong, so fresshe of hewe,<br>
  Constreynde me with so gredy desire,<br>
  That in myn herte I feele yet the fire,<br>
  That made me to ryse er yt wer day,<br>
  And this was now the firste morwe of May,<br>
  With dredful hert, and glad devocioun<br>
  For to ben at the resurreccion<br>
  Of this flour, whan that yt shulde unclose<br>
  Agayne the sonne, that roos as rede as rose<br>
  ...<br>
  And doune on knes anoon ryght I me sette,<br>
  And as I koude, this fresshe flour I grette,<br>
  Knelying alwey, til it unclosed was,<br>
  Upon the smale, softe, swote gras.</blockquote>

Again, in The <i>Cuckoo and the Nightingale</i>, after a wakeful night,
the Poet rises at dawn, and wandering forth, reaches a "laund of white
and green."

<blockquote>  'So feire oon had I nevere in bene,<br>
  The grounde was grene, y poudred with days&eacute;,<br>
  The floures and the gras ilike al hie,<br>
  Al grene and white, was nothing elles sene.'</blockquote>

Of things that in the great world be,<br>

Thou unassuming Common-place <br>
Of Nature, with that homely face,<br>
And yet with something of a grace,<br>
  Which Love makes for thee!<br><br>

Oft on the dappled turf at ease<br>
I sit, and play with similes,<br>
Loose types of things through all degrees,<br>

And many a fond and idle name<br>
I give to thee, for praise or blame,<br>
As is the humour of the game,<br>
  While I am gazing.<br><br>

A nun demure of lowly port;<br>
Or sprightly maiden, of Love's court,<br>
In thy simplicity the sport<br>
  Of all temptations;<br>
A queen in crown of rubies drest;<br>
A starveling in a scanty vest;<br>
Are all, as seems to suit thee best,<br>
  Thy appellations.<br><br>

A little cyclops, with one eye <br>
Staring to threaten and defy,<br>
That thought comes next&mdash;and instantly<br>
  The freak is over,<br>
The shape will vanish&mdash;and behold<br>
A silver shield with boss of gold,<br>
That spreads itself, some faery bold<br>
  In fight to cover!<br><br>

I see thee glittering from afar&mdash;<br>
And then thou art a pretty star;<br>
Not quite so fair as many are <br>
  In heaven above thee!<br>
Yet like a star, with glittering crest,<br>
Self-poised in air thou seem'st to rest;&mdash;<br>
May peace come never to his nest,<br>
Who shall reprove thee!<br><br>

Bright <i>Flower!</i> for by that name at last,<br>
When all my reveries are past,<br>
I call thee, and to that cleave fast,<br>
Sweet silent creature!<br>
That breath'st with me in sun and air,<br>
Do thou, as thou art wont, repair<br>
My heart with gladness, and a share<br>
Of thy meek nature!<br>

<a name="99n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">The three preceding poems 'To the Daisy' evidently belong to the same
time, and are, as Wordsworth expressly says, "overflowings of the mind
in composing the one which stands first." Nevertheless, in the revised
edition of 1836-7, he gave the date 1802 to the first, 1803 to the
third, and 1805 to the second of them. In the earlier editions 1815 to
1832, they are all classed among the "Poems of the Fancy," but in the
edition of 1837, and afterwards, the last, "Bright Flower! whose home is
everywhere," is ranked among the "Poems of Sentiment and Reflection."
They should manifestly be placed together. Wordsworth's fourth poem <i>To
the Daisy</i>, which is an elegy on his brother John, and belongs to a
subsequent year&mdash; having no connection with the three preceding poems,
will be found in its chronological place.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<a name="100n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">Wordsworth gave as the date of the composition of this poem the year
1805; but he said of the following one, <i>To a Young Lady, who had been
Reproached for taking Long Walks in the Country</i>&mdash; "composed at the same
time" and "designed to make one piece"&mdash;that it was written in 1803.<br>
<br>
But it is certain that these following lines appeared in <i>The Morning
Post</i>, on Feb. 12, 1802, where they are headed <i>To a beautiful Young
Lady, who had been harshly spoken of on account of her fondness for
taking long walks in the Country</i>. There is difficulty, both in
ascertaining the exact date of composition, and in knowing who "Louisa"
or the "Young Lady" was. Mrs. Millicent G. Fawcett wrote to me several
years ago, suggesting, with some plausibility, a much earlier date, if
Dorothy Wordsworth was the lady referred to. She referred me to
Dorothy's letter to her aunt, Mrs. Crackenthorpe, written from
Windybrow, Keswick, in 1794, when staying there with her brother; and
says</span>

 <blockquote> "What inclined me to think that the poem was written earlier than 1805
  was that it anticipates Dorothy's marriage, and this would more
  naturally be present as a probable event in W. W.'s mind in 1794 or
  thereabouts than in 1805, after Dorothy had dedicated her life to her
  brother, to the exclusion of all wish to make a home of her own by
  marriage. The expression 'Healthy as a shepherd boy' is also more
  applicable to a girl of twenty-two than to a woman of thirty-three. Do
  you think it possible that the poem may have been written in 1794, and
  not published till later, when its application would be less evident
  to the family circle?"</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Dorothy Wordsworth's letter will be quoted in full in a later volume,
but the following extract from it may be given now:</span>

 <blockquote> "I cannot pass unnoticed that part of your letter in which you speak
  of my 'rambling about the country on foot.' So far from considering
  this as a matter for condemnation I rather thought it would have given
  my friends pleasure that I had courage to make use of the strength
  with which Nature has endowed me, when it not only procured me
  infinitely more pleasure than I should have received from sitting in a
  post-chaise, but was also the means of saving me at least thirty
  shillings."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">I do not think the date of composition can be so early as 1794. What may
be called internal, or structural, evidence is against it. Wordsworth
never could have written these two poems till after his settlement at
Dove Cottage. Besides, in 1794, he could have no knowledge of a possible
"nest in a green dale, a harbour and a hold"; while at that time his
sister had certainly no "cottage home." I believe they were written
after he took up his residence at Town-end (the date being uncertain);
and that they refer to his sister, and not to his wife. It has been
suggested by Mr. Ernest Coleridge (see <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i>, Oct. 21, 1893)
that they refer to Mary Hutchinson: but there is no evidence of
Wordsworth taking long country walks with her before their marriage, or
that she was "nymph-like," "fleet and strong," that she loved to "roam
the moorland," "in weather rough and bleak," or that she "hunted
waterfalls." The reference to his sister is confirmed by the omission of
the delightful second stanza of the poem in the last edition revised by
the poet, that of 1849, when she was a confirmed invalid at Rydal Mount.
Those "smiles to earth unknown," had then ceased for ever. The reason
why Wordsworth erased so delightful and wonderful a stanza, is to me
only explicable on the supposition, that it was his sister he referred
to, she who had accompanied him in former days, in so many of his "long
walks in the country." His wife never did this; she had not the physical
strength to do it; and, if she had been the person referred to,
Wordsworth would hardly, in 1845, have erased such a description of her,
as occurs in the stanza written in 1802, when she was still so vigorous.
Besides, Mary Wordsworth was in no sense "a Child of Nature," as Dorothy
was: while the testimony of the Wordsworth household is explicit, that
it was to his sister, and not to his wife, that the poet referred. I
find no difficulty in the allusion made in the second poem to Dorothy
being yet possibly a "Wife and Friend"; nor to the fact that it was
originally addressed "To a beautiful Young Lady." Neither Dorothy nor
Mary Wordsworth were physically "beautiful," according to our highest
standards; although the poet addressed the latter as "a Phantom of
delight," and as "a lovely apparition." It is quite true that it was
Mary Wordsworth's old age that was "serene and bright," while Dorothy's
was the very reverse; but the poet's anticipation of the future was
written when his sister was young, and was by far the stronger of the
two.&mdash;Ed.</span>

written till some time after the Tour was finished. <i>The Green Linnet</i>
and <i>Yew-trees</i> were written in 1803, and some sonnets were composed in
the month of October; but, on the whole, 1803 was not a fruitful year in
Wordsworth's life, as regards his lyrics and smaller poems. Doubtless
both <i>The Prelude</i> and <i>The Excursion</i> were revised in 1803.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<span style="color: #555555;">The poems associated with the year 1803 consist mainly of the "Memorials
of a Tour in Scotland," which Wordsworth and his sister took&mdash;along with
Coleridge&mdash;in the autumn of that year, although many of these were not
written till some time after the Tour was finished. <i>The Green Linnet</i>
and <i>Yew-trees</i> were written in 1803, and some sonnets were composed in
the month of October; but, on the whole, 1803 was not a fruitful year in
Wordsworth's life, as regards his lyrics and smaller poems. Doubtless
both <i>The Prelude</i> and <i>The Excursion</i> were revised in 1803.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

Their snow white blossoms on my head,<br>

My dazzled sight he oft deceives,<br>
A Brother of the dancing leaves;<br>

He mocked and treated with disdain<br>
The voiceless Form he chose to feign,<br>

<h4>Composed 1803.&mdash;Published 1815</h4>

<a href="#section104a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[Written at Grasmere. These Yew-trees are still standing, but the spread
of that at Lorton is much diminished by mutilation. I will here mention
that a little way up the hill, on the road leading from Rosthwaite to
Stonethwaite (in Borrowdale) lay the trunk of a Yew-tree, which appeared
as you approached, so vast was its diameter, like the entrance of a
cave, and not a small one. Calculating upon what I have observed of the
slow growth of this tree in rocky situations, and of its durability, I
have often thought that the one I am describing must have been as old as
the Christian era. The Tree lay in the line of a fence. Great masses of
its ruins were strewn about, and some had been rolled down the hillside
and lay near the road at the bottom. As you approached the tree, you
were struck with the number of shrubs and young plants, ashes, etc.,
which had found a bed upon the decayed trunk and grew to no
inconsiderable height, forming, as it were, a part of the hedgerow. In
no part of England, or of Europe, have I ever seen a yew-tree at all
approaching this in magnitude, as it must have stood. By the bye,
Hutton, the old guide, of Keswick, had been so impressed with the
remains of this tree, that he used gravely to tell strangers that there
could be no doubt of its having been in existence before the
flood.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>

<a name="104n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">The text of this poem was never altered. The Lorton Yew-tree&mdash;which, in
1803, was "of vast circumference," the "pride of Lorton Vale," and
described as:
</span>
  <blockquote>  'a living thing<br>
  Produced too slowly ever to decay;<br>
  Of form and aspect too magnificent<br>
  To be destroyed&mdash;'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">does not now verify its poet's prediction of the future. Mr. Wilson
Robinson of Whinfell Hall, Cockermouth, wrote to me of it in May 1880:</span>

 <blockquote> "The tree in outline expanded towards the root considerably: then, at
  about two feet from the ground, the trunk began to separate into huge
  limbs, spreading in all directions. I once measured this trunk at its
  least circumference, and found it 23 feet 10 inches. For the last 50
  or 60 years the branches have been gradually dying on the S. E. side,
  and about 25 years ago a strong S. E. gale, coming with accumulated
  force down Hope Gill, and&mdash;owing to the tree being so open on that
  side&mdash;taking it laterally at a disadvantage, wrenched off one of the
  great side branches down to the ground, carrying away nearly a third
  of the tree. This event led to farther peril; for, the second portion
  having been sold to a cabinetmaker at Whitehaven for #15, this gave
  the impression that the wood was very valuable (owing to the celebrity
  of the tree); and a local woodmonger bought the remainder. Two men
  worked half a day to grub it up; but a Cockermouth medical gentleman,
  hearing what was going on, made representations to the owner, and it
  ended in the woodmen sparing the remainder of the tree, which was not
  much the worse for what had been done. Many large dead branches have
  also been cut off, and now we have to regret that the 'pride of Lorton
  Vale,' shorn of its ancient dignity, is but a ruin, much more
  venerable than picturesque."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The "fraternal Four of Borrowdale" are certainly "worthier still of
note." The "trunk" described in the Fenwick note, as on the road between
Rosthwaite and Stonethwaite, has disappeared long ago; but the "solemn
and capacious grove" existed till 1883 in its integrity. The description
in the poem is realistic throughout, while the visible scene suggests</span>

  <blockquote>"an ideal grove, in which the ghostly masters of mankind meet, and
  sleep, and offer worship to the Destiny that abides above them, while
  the mountain flood, as if from another world, makes music to which
  they dimly listen."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">(Stopford A. Brooke, in <i>Theology in the English Poets</i>, p. 259.) With
the first part of the poem Wordsworth's <i>Sonnet composed at &mdash;&mdash; Castle</i>
during the Scotch Tour of 1803 may be compared (p. 410). For a critical
estimate of the poem see <i>Modern Painters</i>, part III. sec. II, chap. iv.
Ruskin alludes to "the real and high action of the imagination in
Wordsworth's <i>Yew-trees</i> (perhaps the most vigorous and solemn bit of
forest landscape ever painted). It is too long to quote, but the reader
should refer to it: let him note especially, if painter, that pure touch
of colour, 'by sheddings from the pining umbrage tinged.'" See also
Coleridge's criticism in <i>Biographia Literaria</i>, vol. ii. p. I77,
edition 1847, and his daughter Sara's comment on her father's note.
There can be little doubt that, as Professor Dowden has suggested, the
lines 23 to 28 were suggested to Wordsworth by Virgil's lines in the
Sixth Book of the <i>&AElig;neid</i>, 273-284:</span>

 <blockquote> 'Vestibulum ante ipsum primisque in faucibus Orci<br>
  Luctus et ultrices posuere cubilia Cur&aelig;;<br>
  Pallentesque habitant Morbi, tristisque Senectus,<br>
  Et Metus, et malesuada Fames, ac turpis Egestas,<br>
  Terribiles visu form&aelig;, Letumque, Labosque;<br>
  Tum consanguineus Leti Sopor, et mala mentis<br>
  Gaudia, mortiferumque adverso in limine Bellum,<br>
  Ferreique Eumenidum thalami, et Discordia demens,<br>
  Vipereum crinem vittis innexa cruentis.<br>
    In medio ramos annosaque bracchia pandit<br>
  Ulmus opaca, ingens, quam sedem Somnia volgo<br>
  Vana tenere ferunt, foliisque sub omnibus h&aelig;rent.'<br>
<br>
<br>
  "The 'Four Yew Trees,' and the mysterious company which you have
  assembled there, 'Death the Skeleton and Time the Shadow.' It is a
  sight not for every youthful poet to dream of; it is one of the last
  results he must have gone thinking for years for."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">(Charles Lamb to Wordsworth, 1815.)<br>
<br>
In Crabb Robinson's <i>Diary</i>, a reference to the Yew-trees of Lorton and
Borrowdale will be found under date Sept. 16 and 20, 1816.</span>

 <blockquote> "The pride of Lorton Vale" is now a ruin, and has lost all its ancient
  majesty: but, until the close of 1883, the "fraternal four" of
  Borrowdale were still to be seen "in grand assemblage." Every one who
  has felt the power of Wordsworth's poetry,&mdash;and especially those who
  had visited the Seathwaite valley, and read the <i>Yew-Trees</i> under the
  shade of that once "solemn and capacious grove" before 1884,&mdash;must
  have felt as if they had lost a personal friend, when they heard that
  the "grove" was gone. The great gale of December 11, 1883, smote it
  fiercely, uprooting one of the trees, and blowing the others to
  ribbands. The following is Mr. Rawnsley's account of the disaster:

<blockquote>'Last week the gale that ravaged England did the Lake country much
    harm. We could spare many of the larch plantations, and could hear
    (with a sigh) of the fall of the giant Scotch firs opposite the
    little Scafell Inn at Rosthwaite, and that Watendlath had lost its
    pines; but who could spare those ancient Yews, the great

     <blockquote> "... fraternal Four of Borrowdale,<br>
      Joined in one solemn and capacious grove;<br>
      Huge trunks! and each particular trunk a growth<br>
      Of intertwisted fibres serpentine<br>
      Up-coiling, and inveterately convolved."</blockquote>

    'For beneath their pillared shade since Wordsworth wrote his poem,
    that Yew-tree grove has suggested to many a wanderer up Borrowdale,
    and visitant to the Natural Temple,

      <blockquote>"an ideal grove in which the ghostly masters of mankind meet, and
      sleep, and offer worship to the Destiny that abides above them,
      while the mountain flood, as if from another world, makes music to
      which they dimly listen."</blockquote>

    'These Yew-trees, seemingly

     <blockquote> "Produced too slowly ever to decay;<br>
      Of form and aspect too magnificent<br>
      To be destroyed,"</blockquote>

    'have been ruthlessly overthrown. One has been uprooted bodily; all
    the leaders and branches of the others have been wrenched from the
    main trunk; and the three still standing are bare poles and broken
    wreckage. Until one visits the spot one can have no conception of
    the wholesale destruction that the hurricane has wrought; until he
    looks on the huge rosy-hearted branches he cannot guess the
    tremendous force with which the tornado had fallen upon that "sable
    roof of boughs."<br>
<br>
    'For tornado or whirlwind it must needs have been. The Yews grew
    under the eastern flank of the hill called Base Brown. The gale
    raged from the westward. One could hardly believe it possible that
    the trees could have been touched by it; for the barrier hill on
    which they grew,&mdash;and under whose shelter they have seen centuries
    of storm,&mdash;goes straight upwards, betwixt them and the west. It was
    only realizable when, standing amid the wreckage, and looking across
    the valley, it was seen that a larch plantation had been entirely
    levelled, and evidently by a wind that was coming from the east, and
    directly toward the Yew-trees. On enquiring at Seathwaite Farm, one
    found that all the slates blown from the roof of that building on
    the west side, had been whirled up clean over the roof: and we can
    only surmise that the winds rushing from the west and north-west,
    and meeting the bastions of Glaramara and the Sty-head slopes, were
    whirled round in the 'cul-de-sac' of the valley, and moved with
    churning motion back from east to west over the Seathwaite Farm, and
    so in straight line across the beck, and up the slope to the
    Yew-tree cluster. With what a wrenching, and with what violence,
    these trees were in a moment shattered, only those can guess who now
    witness the ruins of the pillared shade, upon the "grassless floor
    of red-brown hue."'"</blockquote></blockquote>

<h2><a name="section107"></a> Memorials of a Tour in Scotland</h2>

<h4>1803</h4>

<span style="color: #555555;">These poems were first collected, under the above title, in the edition
of 1827. In 1807, nine of them&mdash;viz. <i>Rob Roy's Grave, The Solitary
Reaper, Stepping Westward, Glen Almain, or, The Narrow Glen, The Matron
of Jedborough and her Husband, To a Highland Girl, Sonnet, To the Sons
of Burns after visiting the Grave of their Father, Yarrow
Unvisited</i>,&mdash;were printed under the title, "Poems written during a Tour
in Scotland." This group begins the second volume of the edition of that
year. But in 1815 and 1820&mdash;when Wordsworth began to arrange his poems
in groups&mdash;they were distributed with the rest of the series in the
several artificial sections. Although some were composed after the Tour
was finished&mdash;and the order in which Wordsworth placed them is not the
order of the Scotch Tour itself&mdash;it is advisable to keep to his own
method of arrangement in dealing with this particular group, for the
same reason that we retain it in such a series as the Duddon
Sonnets.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

Might sometimes covet dissoluble chains;<br>
Even for the tenants of the zone that lies<br>
Beyond the stars, celestial Paradise,<br>
Methinks 'twould heighten joy, to overleap <br>
At will the crystal battlements, and peep<br>
Into some other region, though less fair,<br>
To see how things are made and managed there.<br>
Change for the worse might please, incursion bold<br>
Into the tracts of darkness and of cold; <br>
O'er Limbo lake with a&euml;ry flight to steer,<br>
And on the verge of Chaos hang in fear.<br>
Such animation often do I find,<br>
Power in my breast, wings growing in my mind,<br>
Then, when some rock or hill is overpast, <br>
Perchance without one look behind me cast,<br>
Some barrier with which Nature, from the birth<br>
Of things, has fenced this fairest spot on earth.<br>
O pleasant transit, Grasmere! to resign<br>
Such happy fields, abodes so calm as thine; <br>
Not like an outcast with himself at strife;<br>
The slave of business, time, or care for life,<br>
But moved by choice; or, if constrained in part,<br>
Yet still with Nature's freedom at the heart;&mdash;<br>
To cull contentment upon wildest shores, <br>
And luxuries extract from bleakest moors;<br>
With prompt embrace all beauty to enfold,<br>
And having rights in all that we behold.<br>
&mdash;Then why these lingering steps?&mdash;A bright adieu,<br>
For a brief absence, proves that love is true; <br>
Ne'er can the way be irksome or forlorn<br>
That winds into itself for sweet return.<br>

not actually written till 1811. It originally formed the opening

At thought of what I now behold:<br>
As vapours breathed from dungeons cold<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Strike pleasure dead,<br>
So sadness comes from out the mould <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Burns is laid.<br><br>

And have I then thy bones so near,<br>
And thou forbidden to appear?<br>
As if it were thyself that's here<br>

And both my wishes and my fear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alike are vain.<br>
<br>
Off weight&mdash;nor press on weight!&mdash;away<br>
Dark thoughts!&mdash;they came, but not to stay;<br>
With chastened feelings would I pay <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tribute due<br>
To him, and aught that hides his clay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From mortal view.<br><br>

Fresh as the flower, whose modest worth<br>
He sang, his genius "glinted" forth,<br>
Rose like a star that touching earth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For so it seems,<br>
Doth glorify its humble birth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With matchless beams.<br><br>

The piercing eye, the thoughtful brow,<br>
The struggling heart, where be they now?&mdash;<br>
Full soon the Aspirant of the plough,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prompt, the brave,<br>
Slept, with the obscurest, in the low<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And silent grave. <br><br>

I mourned with thousands, but as one<br>
More deeply grieved, for He was gone<br>
Whose light I hailed when first it shone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And showed my youth<br>
How Verse may build a princely throne<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On humble truth.<br><br>

Alas! where'er the current tends,<br>
Regret pursues and with it blends,&mdash;<br>
Huge Criffel's hoary top ascends<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By Skiddaw seen,&mdash;<br>
Neighbours we were, and loving friends<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We might have been;<br><br>

True friends though diversely inclined;<br>
But heart with heart and mind with mind,<br>
Where the main fibres are entwined,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through Nature's skill,<br>
May even by contraries be joined<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More closely still.<br><br>

The tear will start, and let it flow;<br>
Thou "poor Inhabitant below,"<br>
At this dread moment&mdash;even so&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Might we together<br>
Have sate and talked where gowans blow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or on wild heather.<br><br>

What treasures would have then been placed<br>
Within my reach; of knowledge graced<br>
By fancy what a rich repast!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But why go on?&mdash;<br>
Oh! spare to sweep, thou mournful blast,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His grave grass-grown. <br><br>

There, too, a Son, his joy and pride,<br>
(Not three weeks past the Stripling died,)<br>
Lies gathered to his Father's side,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soul-moving sight!<br>
Yet one to which is not denied<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some sad delight.<br><br>

For <i>he</i> is safe, a quiet bed<br>
Hath early found among the dead,<br>
Harboured where none can be misled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wronged, or distrest;<br>
And surely here it may be said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That such are blest.<br><br>

And oh for Thee, by pitying grace<br>
Checked oft-times in a devious race,<br>
May He who halloweth the place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Man is laid<br>
Receive thy Spirit in the embrace<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For which it prayed!<br><br>

Sighing I turned away; but ere<br>
Night fell I heard, or seemed to hear,<br>
Music that sorrow comes not near,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A ritual hymn,<br>
Chanted in love that casts out fear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By Seraphim.<br>

<a name="109n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">The following is an extract from Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Journal</i> of the
Tour in Scotland:</span>

  <blockquote>"Thursday, August 18th.&mdash; Went to the churchyard where Burns is
  buried. A bookseller accompanied us. He showed us the outside of
  Burns's house, where he had lived the last three years of his life,
  and where he died. It has a mean appearance, and is in a bye
  situation, whitewashed.... Went on to visit his grave. He lies at a
  corner of the churchyard, and his second son, Francis Wallace, beside
  him. There is no stone to mark the spot; but a hundred guineas have
  been collected, to be expended on some sort of monument.

    <blockquote>'There,' said the bookseller, pointing to a pompous monument, 'there
    lies Mr. Such-a-one. I have forgotten his name. A remarkably clever
    man; he was an attorney, and hardly ever lost a cause he undertook.
    Burns made many a lampoon upon him, and there they rest, as you
    see.'</blockquote>

  We looked at the grave with melancholy and painful reflections,
  repeating to each other his own verses.

   <blockquote> 'Is there a man whose judgment clear,<br>
    Can others teach the way to steer,<br>
    Yet runs himself life's mad career,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wild as the wave?<br>
    Here let him pause, and through a tear<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Survey this grave.<br>
    <br>
    The poor Inhabitant below<br>
    Was quick to learn, and wise to know,<br>
    And keenly felt the friendly glow,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And softer flame;<br>
    But thoughtless follies laid him low<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And stained his name.'</blockquote>

  "I cannot take leave of the country which we passed through to-day
  without mentioning that we saw the Cumberland Mountains, within
  half-a-mile of Ellisland, Burns's house, the last view we had of them.
  Drayton has prettily described the connection which this neighbourhood
  has with ours when he makes Skiddaw say:

   <blockquote>                 <a name="fr109E"></a> 'Seurfell<a href="#109E"><sup>E</sup></a> from the sky,<br>
    That Anadale<a href="#109F"><sup>F</sup></a> doth crown, with a most amorous eye,<br>
    Salutes me every day, or at my pride looks grim,<br>
    Oft threatening me with clouds, as I oft threatening him!'</blockquote>

  "These lines recurred to William's memory, and we talked of Burns, and
  of the prospect he must have had, perhaps from his own door, of
  Skiddaw and his companions, including ourselves in the fancy, that we
  <i>might</i> have been personally known to each other, and he have looked
  upon those objects with more pleasure for our sakes."</blockquote>

<td>Too frail to keep the lofty vow<br>
That must have followed when his brow<br>
Was wreathed&mdash;"The Vision" tells us how&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With holly spray,<br>
He faultered, drifted to and fro,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And passed away.<br><br>

Well might such thoughts, dear Sister, throng<br>
Our minds when, lingering all too long,<br>
Over the grave of Burns we hung<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In social grief&mdash;<br>
Indulged as if it were a wrong<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To seek relief.<br><br>

But, leaving each unquiet theme<br>
Where gentlest judgments may misdeem,<br>
And prompt to welcome every gleam<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of good and fair,<br>
Let us beside this limpid Stream<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breathe hopeful air.<br><br>

Enough of sorrow, wreck, and blight;<br>
Think rather of those moments bright<br>
When to the consciousness of right<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His course was true,<br>
When Wisdom prospered in his sight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And virtue grew.<br><br>

Yes, freely let our hearts expand,<br>
Freely as in youth's season bland,<br>
When side by side, his Book in hand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We wont to stray,<br>
Our pleasure varying at command<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of each sweet Lay.<br><br>

How oft inspired must he have trod<br>
These pathways, yon far-stretching road!<br>
There lurks his home; in that Abode,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With mirth elate,<br>
Or in his nobly-pensive mood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Rustic sate.<br><br>

Proud thoughts that Image overawes,<br>
Before it humbly let us pause,<br>
And ask of Nature, from what cause<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And by what rules<br>
She trained her Burns to win applause<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That shames the Schools.<br><br>

Through busiest street and loneliest glen<br>
Are felt the flashes of his pen;<br>
He rules mid winter snows, and when <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bees fill their hives;<br>
Deep in the general heart of men<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His power survives.<br><br>

What need of fields in some far clime<br>
Where Heroes, Sages, Bards sublime,<br>
And all that fetched the flowing rhyme<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  From genuine springs,<br>
Shall dwell together till old Time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Folds up his wings?<br><br>

Sweet Mercy! to the gates of Heaven<br>
This Minstrel lead, his sins forgiven;<br>
The rueful conflict, the heart riven<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With vain endeavour,<br>
And memory of Earth's bitter leaven,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Effaced for ever.<br><br>

But why to Him confine the prayer,<br>
When kindred thoughts and yearnings bear<br>
On the frail heart the purest share<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With all that live?&mdash;<br>
The best of what we do and are,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just God, forgive!<br>

  <blockquote>'These pathways, yon far-stretching road!'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">refers probably to the road to Brownhill, past Ellisland farmhouse
where Burns lived. "The day following" would be Aug. 19th,
1803. The extract which follows from the <i>Journal</i> is a further
illustration of the poem. August 8th.</span>

  <blockquote>"... Travelled through the vale of Nith, here little like a vale, it
  is so broad, with irregular hills rising up on each side, in outline
  resembling the old-fashioned valances of a bed. There is a great deal
  of arable land; the corn ripe; trees here and there&mdash;plantations,
  clumps, coppices, a newness in everything. So much of the gorse and
  broom rooted out that you wonder why it is not all gone, and yet there
  seems to be almost as much gorse and broom as corn; and they grow one
  among another you know not how. Crossed the Nith; the vale becomes
  narrow, and very pleasant; cornfields, green hills, clay cottages; the
  river's bed rocky, with woody banks. Left the Nith about a mile and a
  half, and reached Brownhill, a lonely inn, where we slept. The view
  from the windows was pleasing, though some travellers might have been
  disposed to quarrel with it for its general nakedness; yet there was
  abundance of corn. It is an open country&mdash;open, yet all over hills. At
  a little distance were many cottages among trees, that looked very
  pretty. Brownhill is about seven or eight miles from Ellisland. I
  fancied to myself, while I was sitting in the parlour, that Burns
  might have caroused there, for most likely his rounds extended so far,
  and this thought gave a melancholy interest to the smoky walls...."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">On Dec. 23, 1839, Wordsworth wrote to Professor Henry Reed,
Philadelphia:</span>

  <blockquote>"The other day I chanced to be looking over a MS. poem belonging to
  the year 1803, though not actually composed till many years
  afterwards. It was suggested by visiting the neighbourhood of
  Dumfries, in which Burns had resided, and where he died: it concluded
  thus:

   <blockquote> 'Sweet Mercy! to the gates of Heaven, etc.'</blockquote>

  I instantly added, the other day,

   <blockquote> 'But why to Him confine the prayer, etc.'</blockquote>

  The more I reflect upon this, the more I feel justified in attaching
  comparatively small importance to any literary monument that I may be
  enabled to leave behind. It is well however, I am convinced, that men
  think otherwise in the earlier part of their lives...."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">It may be mentioned that in his note to the "Poems, chiefly
of Early and Late Years," (1842), Wordsworth does not quote
from the text of his sister's <i>Journal</i>,&mdash;which was first published
in 1875,&mdash;but from some other copy of it.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<td>'Mid crowded obelisks and urns<br>
I sought the untimely grave of Burns;<br>
Sons of the Bard, my heart still mourns<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With sorrow true;<br>
And more would grieve, but that it turns <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trembling to you!<br><br>

Through twilight shades of good and ill<br>
Ye now are panting up life's hill,<br>
And more than common strength and skill<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must ye display;<br>
If ye would give the better will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its lawful sway.<br><br>

Hath Nature strung your nerves to bear<br>
Intemperance with less harm, beware!<br>
But if the Poet's wit ye share,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like him can speed<br>
The social hour&mdash;of tenfold care<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be need;<br><br>

For honest men delight will take<br>
To spare your failings for his sake,<br>
Will flatter you,&mdash;and fool and rake<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your steps pursue;<br>
And of your Father's name will make<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A snare for you.<br><br>

Far from their noisy haunts retire,<br>
And add your voices to the quire<br>
That sanctify the cottage fire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With service meet;<br>
There seek the genius of your Sire,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His spirit greet;<br><br>

Or where,'mid "lonely heights and hows,"<br>
He paid to Nature tuneful vows;<br>
Or wiped his honourable brows<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bedewed with toil,<br>
While reapers strove, or busy ploughs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upturned the soil;<br><br>

His judgment with benignant ray<br>
Shall guide, his fancy cheer, your way;<br>
But ne'er to a seductive lay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let faith be given;<br>
Nor deem that "light which leads astray,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is light from Heaven."<br><br>

Let no mean hope your souls enslave;<br>
Be independent, generous, brave;<br>
Your Father such example gave,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And such revere;<br>
But be admonished by his grave,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And think, and fear!<br>

<td>Sweet Highland Girl, a very shower<br>
Of beauty is thy earthly dower!<br>
Twice seven consenting years have shed<br>
Their utmost bounty on thy head:<br>
And these grey rocks; that household lawn;<br>
Those trees, a veil just half withdrawn;<br>
This fall of water that doth make<br>
A murmur near the silent lake;<br>
This little bay; a quiet road<br>
That holds in shelter thy Abode&mdash;<br>
In truth together do ye seem<br>
Like something fashioned in a dream;<br>
Such Forms as from their covert peep<br>
When earthly cares are laid asleep!<br>
But, O fair Creature! in the light<br>
Of common day, so heavenly bright,<br>
I bless Thee, Vision as thou art,<br>
I bless thee with a human heart;<br>
God shield thee to thy latest years!<br>
Thee, neither know I, nor thy peers;<br>
And yet my eyes are filled with tears.<br><br>

  With earnest feeling I shall pray<br>
For thee when I am far away:<br>
For never saw I mien, or face,<br>
In which more plainly I could trace<br>
Benignity and home-bred sense<br>
Ripening in perfect innocence.<br>
Here scattered, like a random seed,<br>
Remote from men, Thou dost not need<br>
The embarrassed look of shy distress,<br>
And maidenly shamefacedness:<br>
Thou wear'st upon thy forehead clear<br>
The freedom of a Mountaineer:<br>
A face with gladness overspread!<br>
Soft smiles, by human kindness bred!<br>
And seemliness complete, that sways<br>
Thy courtesies, about thee plays;<br>
With no restraint, but such as springs<br>
From quick and eager visitings<br>
Of thoughts that lie beyond the reach<br>
Of thy few words of English speech:<br>
A bondage sweetly brooked, a strife<br>
That gives thy gestures grace and life!<br>
So have I, not unmoved in mind,<br>
Seen birds of tempest-loving kind&mdash;<br>
Thus beating up against the wind.<br><br>

  What hand but would a garland cull<br>
For thee who art so beautiful?<br>
O happy pleasure! here to dwell<br>
Beside thee in some heathy dell;<br>
Adopt your homely ways and dress,<br>
A Shepherd, thou a Shepherdess!<br>
But I could frame a wish for thee<br>
More like a grave reality:<br>
Thou art to me but as a wave<br>
Of the wild sea; and I would have<br>
Some claim upon thee, if I could,<br>
Though but of common neighbourhood.<br>
What joy to hear thee, and to see!<br>
Thy elder Brother I would be,<br>
Thy Father&mdash;anything to thee!<br><br>

  Now thanks to Heaven! that of its grace<br>
Hath led me to this lonely place.<br>
Joy have I had; and going hence<br>
I bear away my recompence.<br>
In spots like these it is we prize<br>
Our Memory, feel that she hath eyes:<br>
Then, why should I be loth to stir?<br>
I feel this place was made for her;<br>
To give new pleasure like the past,<br>
Continued long as life shall last.<br>
Nor am I loth, though pleased at heart,<br>
Sweet Highland Girl! from thee to part;<br>
For I, methinks, till I grow old,<br>
As fair before me shall behold,<br>
As I do now, the cabin small,<br>
The lake, the bay, the waterfall;<br>
And Thee, the Spirit of them all!<br>

<a name="112n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">In her <i>Recollections of a Tour made in Scotland</i>, 1803, Dorothy
Wordsworth writes:</span>

  <blockquote>"Sunday, August 28th.&mdash;... After long waiting, the girls, who had been
  on the look-out, informed us that the boat was coming. I went to the
  waterside, and saw a cluster of people on the opposite shore; but,
  being yet at a distance, they looked more like soldiers surrounding a
  carriage than a group of men and women; red and green were the
  distinguishable colours. We hastened to get ourselves ready as soon as
  we saw the party approach, but had longer to wait than we expected,
  the lake being wider than it appears to be. As they drew near we could
  distinguish men in tartan plaids, women in scarlet cloaks, and green
  umbrellas by the half-dozen. The landing was as pretty a sight as ever
  I saw. The bay, which had been so quiet two days before, was all in
  motion with small waves, while the swollen waterfall roared in our
  ears. The boat came steadily up, being pressed almost to the water's
  edge by the weight of its cargo; perhaps twenty people landed, one
  after another. It did not rain much, but the women held up their
  umbrellas; they were dressed in all the colours of the rainbow, and
  with their scarlet cardinals, the tartan plaids of the men, and Scotch
  bonnets, made a gay appearance. There was a joyous bustle surrounding
  the boat, which even imparted something of the same character to the
  waterfall in its tumult, and the restless grey waves; the young men
  laughed and shouted, the lasses laughed, and the elder folks seemed to
  be in a bustle to be away. I remember well with what haste the
  mistress of the house where we were ran up to seek after her child,
  and seeing us, how anxiously and kindly she inquired how we had fared,
  if we had had a good fire, had been well waited upon, etc. All this in
  three minutes&mdash;for the boatman had another party to bring from the
  other side, and hurried us off.<br>
<br>
  "The hospitality we had met with at the two cottages and Mr.
  Macfarlane's gave us very favourable impressions on this our first
  entrance into the Highlands, and at this day the innocent merriment of
  the girls, with their kindness to us, and the beautiful face and
  figure of the elder, come to my mind whenever I think of the
  ferry-house and waterfall of Loch Lomond, and I never think of the two
  girls but the whole image of that romantic spot is before me, a living
  image as it will be to my dying day. The following poem was written by
  William not long after our return from Scotland."</blockquote>

<td>In this still place, remote from men,<br>

In this still place, where murmurs on<br>
But one meek streamlet, only one:<br>
He sang of battles, and the breath<br>
Of stormy war, and violent death;<br>
And should, methinks, when all was past,<br>
Have rightfully been laid at last<br>
Where rocks were rudely heaped, and rent<br>
As by a spirit turbulent;<br>
Where sights were rough, and sounds were wild,<br>
And everything unreconciled;<br>
In some complaining, dim retreat,<br>
For fear and melancholy meet;<br>
But this is calm; there cannot be<br>
A more entire tranquillity.<br><br>

  Does then the Bard sleep here indeed?<br>
Or is it but a groundless creed?<br>
What matters it?&mdash;I blame them not<br>
Whose Fancy in this lonely Spot<br>
Was moved; and in such way expressed<br>
Their notion of its perfect rest.<br>
A convent, even a hermit's cell,<br>
Would break the silence of this Dell:<br>
It is not quiet, is not ease;<br>
But something deeper far than these:<br>
The separation that is here<br>
Is of the grave; and of austere<br>
Yet happy feelings of the dead:<br>
And, therefore, was it rightly said<br>
That Ossian, last of all his race!<br>
Lies buried in this lonely place.<br>

Erskine, who wrote the account of Monzie Parish in Perthshire. This was
in 1795. A recent authority states:</span>

  <blockquote>"'Glenamon,' in Ayrshire, and 'Glenalmond,' in Perthshire, are both
  from the corrupted spelling of the word 'Avon,' which derives from its
  being very nearly the pronunciation of the Gaelic word for 'a river.'

<a name="113n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp;<span style="color: #555555;"> The glen is Glenalmond, in Perthshire, between Crieff and Amulree, known
locally as "the Sma' Glen." I <a name="fr113B">am</a> not aware that it was ever called "Glen
Almain," till Wordsworth gave it that singularly un-Scottish name.<a href="#113B"><sup>B</sup></a>
It must have been a warm August day, after a tract of dry weather, when
he went through it, or the Almond would scarcely have been called a
"small streamlet." In many seasons of the year the distinctive features
of the Glen would be more appropriately indicated by the words, which
the poet uses by way of contrast with his own experience of it, viz. a
place</span>

  <blockquote>'Where sights are rough, and sounds are wild,<br>
  And everything unreconciled.'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">But his characterization of the place&mdash;a glen, the charm of which is
little known&mdash;in the stillness of an autumn afternoon, is as true to
nature as any of his interpretations of the spirit of the hills and
vales of Westmoreland. As yet there is no farm-house, scarcely even a
sheiling, to "break the silence of this Dell."<br>
<br>
The following is Dorothy Wordsworth's account of their walk through it
on Friday, September 9th, 1803:</span>

 <blockquote> "Entered the glen at a small hamlet at some distance from the head,
  and, turning aside a few steps, ascended a hillock which commanded a
  view to the top of it&mdash;a very sweet scene, a green valley, not very
  narrow, with a few scattered trees and huts, almost invisible in a
  misty green of afternoon light. At this hamlet we crossed a bridge,
  and the road led us down the glen, which had become exceedingly
  narrow, and so continued to the end: the hills on both sides heathy
  and rocky, very steep, but continuous; the rock not single or
  overhanging, not scooped into caverns, or sounding with torrents;
  there are no trees, no houses, no traces of cultivation, not one
  outstanding object. It is truly a solitude, the road even making it
  appear still more so; the bottom of the valley is mostly smooth and
  level, the brook not noisy: everything is simple and undisturbed, and
  while we passed through it the whole place was shady, cool, clear, and
  solemn. At the end of the long valley we ascended a hill to a great
  height, and reached the top, when the sun, on the point of setting,
  shed a soft yellow light upon every eminence. The prospect was very
  extensive; over hollows and plains, no towns, and few houses
  visible&mdash;a prospect, extensive as it was, in harmony with the secluded
  dell, and fixing its own peculiar character of removedness from the
  world, and the secure possession of the quiet of nature more deeply in
  our minds. The following poem was written by William on hearing of a
  tradition relating to it, which we did not know when we were there."</blockquote>

<a href="#section114a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
While my Fellow-traveller and I were walking by the side of Loch
Ketterine, one fine evening after sun-set, in our road to a Hut where in
the course of our Tour we had been hospitably entertained some weeks
before, we met, in one of the loneliest parts of that solitary region,
two well dressed Women, one of whom said to us, by way of greeting,
"What, you are stepping westward?"&mdash;W. W. 1807.<br>

Though home or shelter he had none, <br>

The dewy ground was dark and cold;<br>

I liked the greeting; 'twas a sound<br>
Of something without place or bound;<br>
And seemed to give me spiritual right<br>
To travel through that region bright. <br><br>

The voice was soft, and she who spake<br>
Was walking by her native lake:<br>
The salutation had to me<br>
The very sound of courtesy: <br>
Its power was felt; and while my eye<br>
Was fixed upon the glowing Sky,<br>
The echo of the voice enwrought<br>
A human sweetness with the thought<br>
Of travelling through the world that lay <br>
Before me in my endless way.<br>

 <blockquote> "Sunday, Sept. 11th.&mdash;We have never had a more delightful walk than
  this evening. Ben Lomond and the three pointed-topped mountains of
  Loch Lomond, which we had seen from the garrison, were very majestic
  under the clear sky, the lake perfectly calm, the air sweet and mild.
  I felt that it was much more interesting to visit a place where we
  have been before than it can possibly be the first time, except under
  peculiar circumstances. The sun had been set for some time, when,
  being within a quarter of a mile of the ferry man's hut, our path
  having led us close to the shore of the calm lake, we met two
  neatly-dressed women, without hats, who had probably been taking their
  Sunday evening's walk. One of them said to us in a friendly, soft tone
  of voice, 'What, you are stepping westward?' I cannot describe how
  affecting this simple expression was in that remote place, with the
  western sky in front, yet glowing with the departed sun. William wrote
  the following poem long after, in remembrance of his feelings and
  mine."</blockquote>

As if her song could have no ending;<br>
I saw her singing at her work,<br>

I listened, motionless and still;<br>
And, as I mounted up the hill, <br>
The music in my heart I bore,<br>
Long after it was heard no more.<br>

<a name="115n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">The following is from Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Recollections</i> of the Tour:
13th Sept. 1803.</span>

 <blockquote> "As we descended, the scene became more fertile, our way being
  pleasantly varied&mdash;through coppices or open fields, and passing
  farm-houses, though always with an intermixture of cultivated ground.
  It was harvest-time, and the fields were quietly&mdash;might I be allowed
  to say pensively?&mdash;enlivened by small companies of reapers. It is not
  uncommon in the more lonely parts of the Highlands to see a single
  person so employed. The following poem was suggested to William by a
  beautiful sentence in Thomas Wilkinson's <i>Tour in Scotland.</i>"</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">In a note appended to the editions 1807 to 1820, Wordsworth wrote:</span>

 <blockquote> "This Poem was suggested by a beautiful sentence in a MS. 'Tour in
  Scotland,' written by a Friend, the last line being taken from it
  <i>verbatim.</i>"</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The first part of Wilkinson's <i>Tours to the British Mountains</i>, which
was published in 1824, narrates his journey in Scotland (it took place
in 1787); and the following sentence occurs in the record of his travels
near Loch Lomond (p. 12),</span>

  <blockquote>"Passed a female who was reaping alone: she sung in Erse, as she
  bended over her sickle; the sweetest human voice I ever heard: her
  strains were tenderly melancholy, and felt delicious, long after they
  were heard no more."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">There can be no doubt that this is the sentence referred to both by
Dorothy and William Wordsworth. Thomas Wilkinson was the friend, in
whose memory Wordsworth wrote the poem <i>To the Spade of a Friend,
composed while we were labouring together in his pleasure-ground</i>. They
were comparatively near neighbours, as Wilkinson lived near Yanwath on
the Emont; and he had given his MS. to the Wordsworth family to read. I
have received some additional information about this MS., and
Wordsworth's knowledge of it, from Mr. Wilson Robinson, who writes,</span>

 <blockquote> "From all the evidence, I conclude that Wilkinson's 'Tour to the
  Highlands' was shown in manuscript to his friends soon after his
  return;&mdash;that he was not only willing to show it, but even to allow it
  to be copied, though reluctant to publish it;&mdash;that there was
  sufficient intimacy between him and the Wordsworths to account for his
  showing or lending the manuscript to them, especially as they had
  travelled over much of the same ground, and would therefore be more
  interested in it; and that in fact it was never published till 1824."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">When Wordsworth was living at Coleorton during the late autumn of 1806
he wrote to Wilkinson:</span>

<blockquote>  "... What shall I say in apology for your Journal, which is now locked
  up with my manuscripts at Grasmere. As I could not go over to your
  part of the country myself, my intention was to have taken it with me
  to Kendal,... to be carefully transmitted to you; unluckily, most
  unluckily, in the hurry of departure, I forgot it, together with two
  of my own manuscripts which were along with it; and I am afraid you
  will be standing in great need of it.... If you do not want it, it is
  in a place where it can take no injury, and I may have the pleasure of
  delivering it to you myself in the spring...."</blockquote>

<td>Child of loud-throated War! the mountain Stream<br>
Roars in thy hearing; but thy hour of rest<br>
Is come, and thou art silent in thy age;<br>
Save when the wind sweeps by and sounds are caught<br>
Ambiguous, neither wholly thine nor theirs.<br>
Oh! there is life that breathes not; Powers there are<br>
That touch each other to the quick in modes<br>
Which the gross world no sense hath to perceive,<br>
No soul to dream of. What art Thou, from care<br>
Cast off&mdash;abandoned by thy rugged Sire,<br>
Nor by soft Peace adopted; though, in place<br>
And in dimension, such that thou might'st seem<br>
But a mere footstool to yon sovereign Lord,<br>
Huge Cruachan, (a thing that meaner hills<br>
Might crush, nor know that it had suffered harm;)<br>
Yet he, not loth, in favour of thy claims<br>
To reverence, suspends his own; submitting<br>
All that the God of Nature hath conferred,<br>
All that he holds in common with the stars,<br>
To the memorial majesty of Time<br>
Impersonated in thy calm decay!<br><br>

Take, then, thy seat, Vicegerent unreproved!<br>
Now, while a farewell gleam of evening light<br>
Is fondly lingering on thy shattered front,<br>
Do thou, in turn, be paramount; and rule<br>
Over the pomp and beauty of a scene<br>
Whose mountains, torrents, lake, and woods, unite<br>
To pay thee homage; and with these are joined,<br>
In willing admiration and respect,<br>
Two Hearts, which in thy presence might be called<br>
Youthful as Spring.&mdash;Shade of departed Power,<br>
Skeleton of unfleshed humanity,<br>
The chronicle were welcome that should call<br>
Into the compass of distinct regard<br>
The toils and struggles of thy infant years!<br>
Yon foaming flood seems motionless as ice;<br>
Its dizzy turbulence eludes the eye,<br>
Frozen by distance; so, majestic Pile,<br>
To the perception of this Age, appear<br>
Thy fierce beginnings, softened and subdued<br>
And quieted in character&mdash;the strife,<br>
The pride, the fury uncontrollable,<br>
Lost on the aerial heights of the Crusades!"<br>

in making his quotation in 1827: August 31, 1803.</span>

 <blockquote> "When we had ascended half-way up the hill, directed by the man, I
  took a nearer foot-path, and at the top came in view of a most
  impressive scene, a ruined castle on an island almost in the middle of
  the last compartment of the lake, backed by a mountain cove, down
  which came a roaring stream. The castle occupied every foot of the
  island that was visible to us, appearing to rise out of the water;
  mists rested upon the mountain side, with spots of sunshine between;
  there was a mild desolation in the low grounds, a solemn grandeur in
  the mountains, and the castle was wild, yet stately, not dismantled of
  its turrets, nor the walls broken down, though completely in ruin.
  After having stood some minutes I joined William on the highroad, and
  both wishing to stay longer near this place, we requested the man to
  drive his little boy on to Dalmally, about two miles further, and
  leave the car at the inn. He told us the ruin was called Kilchurn
  Castle, that it belonged to Lord Breadalbane, and had been built by
  one of the ladies of that family for her defence, during her lord's
  absence at the Crusades; for which purpose she levied a tax of seven
  years' rent upon her tenants; he said that from that side of the lake
  it did not appear, in very dry weather, to stand upon an island, but
  that it was possible to go over to it without being wet-shod. We were
  very lucky in seeing it after a great flood; for its enchanting effect
  was chiefly owing to its situation in the lake, a decayed palace
  rising out of the plain of waters! I have called it a palace, for such
  feeling it gave me, though having been built as a place of defence, a
  castle or fortress. We turned again and reascended the hill, and sate
  a long time in the middle of it looking on the castle, and the huge
  mountain cove opposite, and William, addressing himself to the ruin,
  poured out these verses."</blockquote>

<h4>Composed between 1803 and 1805.&mdash;Published 1807</h4>

<a href="#section117a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
The History of Rob Roy is sufficiently known; his Grave is near the head
of Loch Ketterine, in one of those small Pin-fold-like Burial-grounds,
of neglected and desolate appearance, which the Traveller meets with in
the Highlands of Scotland. &mdash;W. W. 1807.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[I have since been told that I was misinformed as to the burial-place of
Rob Roy. If so, I may plead in excuse that I wrote on apparently good
authority, namely, that of a well educated Lady who lived at the head of
the Lake, within a mile or less of the point indicated as containing the
remains of One so famous in the neighbourhood.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">In the copy of <i>Rob Roy's Grave</i>, transcribed in Dorothy Wordsworth's
'Recollections' of the Tour in Scotland of 1803, there are several
important variations of text, which occur in none of the printed
editions of the poem. These are indicated (to distinguish them from
other readings) by the initials D. W.&mdash;Ed.<br>

<td>A famous man is Robin Hood,<br>
The English ballad-singer's joy!<br>
And Scotland has a thief as good,<br>
An outlaw of as daring mood;<br><br>

She has her brave<b> Rob Roy</b>!<br>
Then clear the weeds from off his Grave,<br>
And let us chant a passing stave,<br>
In honour of that Hero brave!<br><br>

Heaven gave Rob Roy a dauntless heart<br>
And wondrous length and strength of arm:<br>
Nor craved he more to quell his foes,<br>
  Or keep his friends from harm.<br><br>

Yet was Rob Roy as <i>wise</i> as brave;<br>
Forgive me if the phrase be strong;&mdash;<br>
A Poet worthy of Rob Roy<br>
  Must scorn a timid song.<br><br>

Say, then, that he was wise as brave;<br>
As wise in thought as bold in deed:<br>
For in the principles of things<br>
  <i>He</i> sought his moral creed.<br><br>

Said generous Rob, "What need of books?<br>
Burn all the statutes and their shelves:<br>
They stir us up against our kind;<br>
  And worse, against ourselves.<br><br>

"We have a passion&mdash;make a law,<br>
Too false to guide us or control!<br>
And for the law itself we fight<br>
  In bitterness of soul.<br><br>

"And, puzzled, blinded thus, we lose<br>
Distinctions that are plain and few:<br>
These find I graven on my heart:<br>
  <i>That</i> tells me what to do.<br><br>

"The creatures see of flood and field,<br>
And those that travel on the wind!<br>
With them no strife can last; they live <br>
  In peace, and peace of mind.<br><br>

"For why?&mdash;because the good old rule<br>
Sufficeth them, the simple plan,<br>
That they should take, who have the power,<br>
  And they should keep who can.<br><br>

"A lesson that is quickly learned,<br>
A signal this which all can see!<br>
Thus nothing here provokes the strong<br>
  To wanton cruelty.<br><br>

"All freakishness of mind is checked;<br>
He tamed, who foolishly aspires;<br>
While to the measure of his might<br>
  Each fashions his desires.<br><br>

"All kinds, and creatures, stand and fall<br>
By strength of prowess or of wit:<br>
'Tis God's appointment who must sway,<br>
  And who is to submit.<br><br>

"Since, then, the rule of right is plain,<br>
And longest life is but a day;<br>
To have my ends, maintain my rights,<br>
  I'll take the shortest way."<br><br>

And thus among these rocks he lived,<br>
Through summer heat and winter snow:<br>
The Eagle, he was lord above,<br>
  And Rob was lord below.<br><br>

So was it&mdash;<i>would</i>, at least, have been<br>
But through untowardness of fate;<br>
For Polity was then too strong&mdash;<br>
  He came an age too late;<br><br>

Or shall we say an age too soon?<br>
For, were the bold Man living <i>now</i>,<br>
How might he flourish in his pride,<br>
  With buds on every bough!<br><br>

Then rents and factors, rights of chase,<br>
Sheriffs, and lairds and their domains,<br>
Would all have seemed but paltry things,<br>
  Not worth a moment's pains.<br><br>

Rob Roy had never lingered here,<br>
To these few meagre Vales confined;<br>
But thought how wide the world, the times<br>
  How fairly to his mind!<br><br>

And to his Sword he would have said,<br>
"Do Thou my sovereign will enact<br>
From land to land through half the earth!<br>
  Judge thou of law and fact!<br><br>

"'Tis fit that we should do our part,<br>
Becoming, that mankind should learn<br>
That we are not to be surpassed<br>
  In fatherly concern.<br><br>

"Of old things all are over old, <br>
Of good things none are good enough:&mdash;<br>
We'll show that we can help to frame<br>
  A world of other stuff.<br><br>

"I, too, will have my kings that take<br>
From me the sign of life and death: <br>
Kingdoms shall shift about, like clouds,<br>
  Obedient to my breath."<br><br>

And, if the word had been fulfilled,<br>
As <i>might</i> have been, then, thought of joy!<br>
France would have had her present Boast,<br>
  And we our own Rob Roy!<br><br>

Oh! say not so; compare them not;<br>
I would not wrong thee, Champion brave!<br>
Would wrong thee nowhere; least of all<br>
  Here standing by thy grave. <br><br>

For Thou, although with some wild thoughts<br>
Wild Chieftain of a savage Clan!<br>
Hadst this to boast of; thou didst love<br>
  The <i>liberty</i> of man.<br><br>

And, had it been thy lot to live<br>
With us who now behold the light,<br>
Thou would'st have nobly stirred thyself,<br>
  And battled for the Right.<br><br>

For thou wert still the poor man's stay,<br>
The poor man's heart, the poor man's hand;<br>
And all the oppressed, who wanted strength,<br>
  Had thine at their command.<br><br>

Bear witness many a pensive sigh<br>
Of thoughtful Herdsman when he strays<br>
Alone upon Loch Veol's heights,<br>
  And by Loch Lomond's braes!<br><br>

And, far and near, through vale and hill,<br>
Are faces that attest the same;<br>
The proud heart flashing through the eyes,<br>
  At sound of <b>Rob Roy's</b> name.<br>

to prove the extraordinary length of their Hero's arm, tell you that "he
could garter his Tartan Stockings below the knee when standing upright."
According to their account he was a tremendous Swordsman; after having
sought all occasions of proving his prowess, he was never conquered but
once, and this not till he was an Old Man.&mdash;W. W. 1807.<br>

<a name="117n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp;<span style="color: #555555;"> In Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Recollections</i> of the Scotch Tour the
following occurs:</span>

<blockquote>"August 27, 1803.&mdash;We mentioned Rob Roy, and the eyes
of all glistened; even the lady of the house, who was very diffident,
and no great talker, exclaimed, 'He was a good man, Rob Roy! he had been
dead only about eighty years, had lived in the next farm, which belonged
to him, and there his bones were laid.' He was a famous swordsman.
Having an arm much longer than other men, he had a greater command with
his sword. As a proof of the length of his arm, they told us that he
could garter his tartan stockings below the knee without stooping, and
added a dozen different stories of single combats, which he had fought,
all in perfect good humour, merely to prove his prowess. I daresay they
had stories of this kind which would hardly have been exhausted in the
long evenings of a whole December week, Rob Roy being as famous here as
even Robin Hood was in the forest of Sherwood; <i>he</i> also robbed
from the rich, giving to the poor, and defending them from oppression.
They tell of his confining the factor of the Duke of Montrose in one of
the islands of Loch Ketterine, after having taken his money from
him&mdash;the Duke's rents&mdash;in open day, while they were sitting at table. He
was a formidable enemy of the Duke, but being a small laird against a
greater, was overcome at last, and forced to resign all his lands on the
Braes of Loch Lomond, including the caves which we visited, on account
of the money he had taken from the Duke and could not repay."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">September 12:</span>

  <blockquote>"Descended into Glengyle, above Loch Ketterine, and passed through Mr.
  Macfarlane's grounds, that is, through the whole of the glen, where
  there was now no house left but his. We stopped at his door to inquire
  after the family, though with little hope of finding them at home,
  having seen a large company at work in a hay-field, whom we
  conjectured to be his whole household, as it proved, except a
  servant-maid who answered our enquiries. We had sent the ferryman
  forward from the head of the glen to bring the boat round from the
  place where he left it to the other side of the lake. Passed the same
  farm-house we had such good reason to remember, and went up to the
  burying-ground that stood so sweetly near the water-side. The ferryman
  had told us that Rob Roy's grave was there, so we could not pass on
  without going up to the spot. There were several tombstones, but the
  inscriptions were either worn-out or unintelligible to us, and the
  place choked up with nettles and brambles. You will remember the
  description I have given of the spot. I have nothing here to add,
  except the following poem which it suggested to William."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Rob Roy was buried at the Kirkton of Balquhidder, near the outlet of
Loch Voil in Perthshire. There are three sculptured stones in the rude
burial-place of the Macgregors, at the eastern end of the old church.
The one with the long claymore marks the resting-place of Rob Roy's
wife; the one opposite on the other side is the tomb of his eldest son;
and the central stone, more elaborately carved, marks the grave of the
hero himself.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

  stands upon a green hill, over-looking the Tweed, a strong
  square-towered edifice, neglected and desolate, though not in ruin,
  the garden overgrown with grass, and the high walls that fenced it
  broken down. The Tweed winds between green steeps, upon which, and
  close to the river side, large flocks of sheep pasturing; higher still
  are the grey mountains; but I need not describe the scene, for William
  has done it better than I could do in a sonnet which he wrote the same

"Whate'er betide, we'll turn aside,<br>
And see the Braes of Yarrow."<br><br>

"Let Yarrow folk, <i>frae</i> Selkirk town,<br>

Go back to Yarrow, 'tis their own;<br>

Nor turn aside to Yarrow.<br>

Both lying right before us;<br>
And Dryborough, where with chiming Tweed<br>
The lintwhites sing in chorus;<br>
There's pleasant Tiviot-dale, a land<br>

Why throw away a needful day<br>
To go in search of Yarrow?<br><br>

That glides the dark hills under?<br>
There are a thousand such elsewhere<br>

I thus could speak of Yarrow!<br><br>

"Oh! green," said I, "are Yarrow's holms,<br>
And sweet is Yarrow flowing!<br>
Fair hangs the apple frae the rock,<br>
But we will leave it growing.<br>
O'er hilly path, and open Strath,<br>
We'll wander Scotland thorough;<br>

There's such a place as Yarrow.<br><br>

"Be Yarrow stream unseen, unknown!<br>
It must, or we shall rue it:<br>
We have a vision of our own;<br>
Ah! why should we undo it?<br>
The treasured dreams of times long past,<br>
We'll keep them, winsome Marrow!<br>
For when we're there, although 'tis fair,<br>
'Twill be another Yarrow.<br><br>

"If Care with freezing years should come,<br>
And wandering seem but folly,&mdash;<br>
Should we be loth to stir from home,<br>
And yet be melancholy;<br>
Should life be dull, and spirits low,<br>
'Twill soothe us in our sorrow,<br>
That earth has something yet to show,<br>
The bonny holms of Yarrow!"<br>

reports a conversation, in which the poet said to him, </span>

  <blockquote>"Scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on <i>Yarrow</i>, He makes
  me write,

   <blockquote> 'The swans on sweet St. Mary's Lake<br>
    Float double, swans and shadow;'</blockquote>

  but I wrote,

    <blockquote>'The <i>swan</i> on <i>still</i> St. Mary's Lake.'</blockquote>

  Never could I have written 'swans' in the plural. The scene when I saw
  it, with its still and dim lake, under the dusky hills, was one of
  utter loneliness: there was <i>one</i> swan, and one only, stemming the
  water, and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to
  the one companion of that swan, its own white image in the water. It
  was for that reason that I recorded the Swan and the Shadow. Had there
  been many swans and many shadows, they would have implied nothing as
  regards the character of the place; and I should have said nothing
  about them."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">See his <i>Essays, chiefly on Poetry</i>, vol. ii. p. 277.<br>
<br>
Wordsworth wrote to his friend, Walter Scott, to thank him for a copy of
<i>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</i>, and in return sent a copy of these
stanzas, <i>Yarrow Unvisited</i>. Scott replied gratefully on the 16th March
1805, and said,</span>

  <blockquote>"... I by no means admit your apology, however ingeniously and
  artfully stated, for not visiting the bonny holms of Yarrow, and
  certainly will not rest till I have prevailed upon you to compare the
  ideal with the real stream."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Wordsworth had asked him if he could suggest any name more true to the
place than Burnmill, in the line, "The sweets of Burn-mill meadow."
Scott replied:</span>

 <blockquote> "We have Broad-meadow upon Yarrow, which with the addition of green or
  fair or any other epithet of one syllable, will give truth to the
  locality, and supply the place of Burnmill meadow, which we have not.
  ... I like your swan upon St. Mary's Lake. How came you to know that
  it is actually frequented by that superb bird?"</blockquote>

  mile and a half or two miles of Clovenford, where we were to lodge.
  Turned up the side of a hill, and went along sheep-grounds till we
  reached the spot&mdash;a single stone house, without a tree near it or to
  be seen from it. On our mentioning Mr. Scott's name, the woman of the
  house showed us all possible civility, but her slowness was really
  amusing. I should suppose it a house little frequented, for there is
  no appearance of an inn. Mr. Scott, who she told me was a very clever
  gentleman, 'goes there in the fishing season;' but indeed Mr. Scott is
  respected everywhere; I believe that by favour of his name one might
  be hospitably entertained throughout all the borders of Scotland. We

Our Human-nature throws away<br>
Its second twilight, and looks gay;<br>
A land of promise and of pride<br>
Unfolding, wide as life is wide.<br><br>

  Ah! see her helpless Charge! enclosed<br>

To fear of loss, and hope of gain,<br>
The strife of happiness and pain,<br>
Utterly dead! yet in the guise<br>
Of little infants, when their eyes<br>
Begin to follow to and fro<br>

He tracks her motions, quick or slow.<br>
Her buoyant spirit can prevail<br>
Where common cheerfulness would fail;<br>
She strikes upon him with the heat<br>
Of July suns; he feels it sweet;<br>
An animal delight though dim!<br>
'Tis all that now remains for him!<br><br>

And, while I scanned them o'er and o'er,<br>

Broke from the Matron's strong black eye&mdash;<br>
A remnant of uneasy light,<br>
A flash of something over-bright!<br>
Nor long this mystery did detain <br>
My thoughts;&mdash;she told in pensive strain<br>
That she had borne a heavy yoke,<br>
Been stricken by a twofold stroke;<br>
Ill health of body; and had pined<br>
Beneath worse ailments of the mind. <br><br>

  So be it!&mdash;but let praise ascend<br>
To Him who is our lord and friend!<br>
Who from disease and suffering<br>
Hath called for thee a second spring;<br>
Repaid thee for that sore distress<br>
By no untimely joyousness;<br>
Which makes of thine a blissful state;<br>

 <blockquote> "We were received with hearty welcome by a good woman, who, though
  above seventy years old, moved about as briskly as if she was only
  seventeen. Those parts of the house which we were to occupy were neat
  and clean; she showed me every corner, and, before I had been ten
  minutes in the house, opened her very drawers that I might see what a
  stock of linen she had; then asked how long we should stay, and said
  she wished we were come for three months. She was a most remarkable
  person; the alacrity with which she ran up-stairs when we rung the
  bell, and guessed at, and strove to prevent, our wants was surprising;
  she had a quick eye, and keen strong features, and a joyousness in her
  motions, like what used to be in old Molly when she was particularly
  elated. I found afterwards that she had been subject to fits of
  dejection and ill-health: we then conjectured that her overflowing
  gaiety and strength might in part be attributed to the same cause as
  her former dejection. Her husband was deaf and infirm, and sate in a
  chair with scarcely the power to move a limb&mdash;an affecting contrast!
  The old woman said they had been a very hard-working pair; they had
  wrought like slaves at their trade&mdash;her husband had been a currier;
  and she told me how they had portioned off their daughters with money,
  and each a feather bed, and that in their old age they had laid out
  the little they could spare in building and furnishing that house, and
  she added with pride that she had lived in her youth in the family of
  Lady Egerton, who was no high lady, and now was in the habit of coming
  to her house whenever she was at Jedburgh, and a hundred other things;
  for when she once began with Lady Egerton, she did not know how to
  stop, nor did I wish it, for she was very entertaining. Mr. Scott sat
  with us an hour or two, and repeated a part of the <i>Lay of the Last
  Minstrel</i>. When he was gone our hostess came to see if we wanted
  anything, and to wish us good-night. On all occasions her manners were
  governed by the same spirit: there was no withdrawing one's attention
  from her. We were so much interested that William, long afterwards,
  thought it worth while to express in verse the sensations which she
  had excited, and which then remained as vividly in his mind as at the
  moment when we lost sight of Jedburgh."</blockquote>

<td>Now we are tired of boisterous joy,<br>
Have romped enough, my little Boy!<br>
Jane hangs her head upon my breast,<br>
And you shall bring your stool and rest;<br>
  This corner is your own.<br><br>

There! take your seat, and let me see<br>
That you can listen quietly:<br>
And, as I promised, I will tell<br>
That strange adventure which befel<br>
  A poor blind Highland Boy.<br><br>

A <i>Highland</i> Boy!&mdash;why call him so?<br>
Because, my Darlings, ye must know<br>
That, under hills which rise like towers,<br>
Far higher hills than these of ours!<br>
  He from his birth had lived.<br><br>

He ne'er had seen one earthly sight<br>
The sun, the day; the stars, the night;<br>
Or tree, or butterfly, or flower,<br>
Or fish in stream, or bird in bower,<br>
  Or woman, man, or child.<br><br>

And yet he neither drooped nor pined,<br>
Nor had a melancholy mind;<br>
For God took pity on the Boy,<br>
And was his friend; and gave him joy<br>
  Of which we nothing know. <br><br>

His Mother, too, no doubt, above<br>
Her other children him did love:<br>
For, was she here, or was she there,<br>
She thought of him with constant care,<br>
  And more than mother's love.<br><br>

And proud she was of heart, when clad<br>
In crimson stockings, tartan plaid,<br>
And bonnet with a feather gay,<br>
To Kirk he on the sabbath day<br>
  Went hand in hand with her.<br><br>

A dog too, had he; not for need,<br>
But one to play with and to feed;<br>
Which would have led him, if bereft<br>
Of company or friends, and left<br>
  Without a better guide.<br><br>

And then the bagpipes he could blow&mdash;<br>
And thus from house to house would go;<br>
And all were pleased to hear and see,<br>
For none made sweeter melody<br>
  Than did the poor blind Boy.<br><br>

Yet he had many a restless dream;<br>
Both when he heard the eagles scream,<br>
And when he heard the torrents roar,<br>
And heard the water beat the shore<br>
  Near which their cottage stood.<br><br>

Beside a lake their cottage stood,<br>
Not small like ours, a peaceful flood;<br>
But one of mighty size, and strange;<br>
That, rough or smooth, is full of change,<br>
  And stirring in its bed. <br><br>

For to this lake, by night and day,<br>
The great Sea-water finds its way<br>
Through long, long windings of the hills<br>
And drinks up all the pretty rills<br>
  And rivers large and strong:<br><br>

Then hurries back the road it came&mdash;<br>
Returns, on errand still the same;<br>
This did it when the earth was new;<br>
And this for evermore will do,<br>
  As long as earth shall last. <br><br>

And, with the coming of the tide,<br>
Come boats and ships that safely ride<br>
Between the woods and lofty rocks;<br>
And to the shepherds with their flocks<br>
Bring tales of distant lands.<br><br>

And of those tales, whate'er they were,<br>
The blind Boy always had his share;<br>
Whether of mighty towns, or vales<br>
With warmer suns and softer gales,<br>
    Or wonders of the Deep.<br><br>

Yet more it pleased him, more it stirred,<br>
When from the water-side he heard<br>
The shouting, and the jolly cheers;<br>
The bustle of the mariners<br>
    In stillness or in storm.<br><br>

But what do his desires avail?<br>
For He must never handle sail;<br>
Nor mount the mast, nor row, nor float<br>
In sailor's ship, or fisher's boat,<br>
    Upon the rocking waves.<br><br>

His Mother often thought, and said,<br>
What sin would be upon her head<br>
If she should suffer this: "My Son,<br>
Whate'er you do, leave this undone;<br>
    The danger is so great."<br><br>

Thus lived he by Loch-Leven's side<br>
Still sounding with the sounding tide,<br>
And heard the billows leap and dance,<br>
Without a shadow of mischance,<br>
    Till he was ten years old.<br><br>

When one day (and now mark me well,<br>
Ye soon shall know how this befell)<br>
He in a vessel of his own,<br>
On the swift flood is hurrying down,<br>
    Down to the mighty Sea.<br><br>

In such a vessel never more<br>
May human creature leave the Shore!<br>
If this or that way he should stir,<br>
Woe to the poor blind Mariner!<br>
  For death will be his doom.<br>
<br>
But say what bears him?&mdash;Ye have seen<br>
The Indian's bow, his arrows keen,<br>
Rare beasts, and birds with plumage bright;<br>
Gifts which, for wonder or delight,<br>
  Are brought in ships from far.<br><br>

Such gifts had those seafaring men<br>
Spread round that haven in the glen;<br>
Each hut, perchance, might have its own;<br>
And to the Boy they all were known&mdash;<br>
   He knew and prized them all.<br><br>

The rarest was a Turtle-shell<br>
Which he, poor Child, had studied well;<br>
A shell of ample size, and light<br>
As the pearly car of Amphitrite,<br>
  That sportive dolphins drew.<br><br>

And, as a Coracle that braves<br>
On Vaga's breast the fretful waves,<br>
This shell upon the deep would swim,<br>
And gaily lift its fearless brim<br>
  Above the tossing surge.<br><br>

And this the little blind Boy knew:<br>
And he a story strange yet true<br>
Had heard, how in a shell like this<br>
An English Boy, O thought of bliss!<br>
  Had stoutly launched from shore;<br><br>

Launched from the margin of a bay<br>
Among the Indian isles, where lay<br>
His father's ship, and had sailed far&mdash;<br>
To join that gallant ship of war,<br>
  In his delightful shell.<br><br>

Our Highland Boy oft visited<br>
'The house that held this prize; and, led<br>
By choice or chance, did thither come<br>
One day when no one was at home,<br>
  And found the door unbarred.<br><br>

While there he sate, alone and blind,<br>
That story flashed upon his mind;&mdash;<br>
A bold thought roused him, and he took<br>
The shell from out its secret nook,<br>
   And bore it on his head.<br><br>

He launched his vessel,&mdash;and in pride<br>
Of spirit, from Loch-Leven's side,<br>
Stepped into it&mdash;his thoughts all free<br>
As the light breezes that with glee<br>
   Sang through the adventurer's hair.<br><br>

A while he stood upon his feet;<br>
He felt the motion&mdash;took his seat;<br>
Still better pleased as more and more<br>
The tide retreated from the shore,<br>
   And sucked, and sucked him in.<br><br>

And there he is in face of Heaven.<br>
How rapidly the Child is driven!<br>
The fourth part of a mile, I ween,<br>
He thus had gone, ere he was seen<br>
   By any human eye.<br><br>

But when he was first seen, oh me<br>
What shrieking and what misery!<br>
For many saw; among the rest<br>
His Mother, she who loved him best,<br>
  She saw her poor blind Boy.<br><br>

But for the child, the sightless Boy,<br>
It is the triumph of his joy!<br>
The bravest traveller in balloon,<br>
Mounting as if to reach the moon,<br>
  Was never half so blessed. <br><br>

And let him, let him go his way,<br>
Alone, and innocent, and gay!<br>
For, if good Angels love to wait<br>
On the forlorn unfortunate,<br>
  This Child will take no harm.<br><br>

But now the passionate lament,<br>
Which from the crowd on shore was sent,<br>
The cries which broke from old and young<br>
In Gaelic, or the English tongue,<br>
  Are stifled&mdash;all is still.<br><br>

And quickly with a silent crew<br>
A boat is ready to pursue;<br>
And from the shore their course they take,<br>
And swiftly down the running lake<br>
  They follow the blind Boy.<br><br>

But soon they move with softer pace;<br>
So have ye seen the fowler chase<br>
On Grasmere's clear unruffled breast<br>
A youngling of the wild-duck's nest<br>
  With deftly-lifted oar; <br><br>

Or as the wily sailors crept<br>
To seize (while on the Deep it slept)<br>
The hapless creature which did dwell<br>
Erewhile within the dancing shell,<br>
  They steal upon their prey.<br><br>

With sound the least that can be made,<br>
They follow, more and more afraid,<br>
More cautious as they draw more near;<br>
But in his darkness he can hear,<br>
  And guesses their intent.<br><br>

"<i>Lei-gha&mdash;Lei-gha</i>"&mdash;he then cried out,<br>
"<i>Lei-gha&mdash;Lei-gha</i>"&mdash;with eager shout;<br>
Thus did he cry, and thus did pray,<br>
And what he meant was, "Keep away,<br>
  And leave me to myself!"<br><br>

Alas! and when he felt their hands&mdash;<br>
You've often heard of magic wands,<br>
That with a motion overthrow<br>
A palace of the proudest show,<br>
  Or melt it into air:<br><br>

So all his dreams&mdash;that inward light<br>
With which his soul had shone so bright&mdash;<br>
All vanished;&mdash;'twas a heartfelt cross<br>
To him, a heavy, bitter loss,<br>
  As he had ever known.<br><br>

But hark! a gratulating voice,<br>
With which the very hills rejoice:<br>
'Tis from the crowd, who tremblingly<br>
Have watched the event, and now can see<br>
  That he is safe at last.<br><br>

And then, when he was brought to land,<br>
Full sure they were a happy band,<br>
Which, gathering round, did on the banks<br>
Of that great Water give God thanks,<br>
  And welcomed the poor Child. <br><br>

And in the general joy of heart<br>
The blind Boy's little dog took part;<br>
He leapt about, and oft did kiss<br>
His master's hands in sign of bliss,<br>
  With sound like lamentation.<br><br>

But most of all, his Mother dear,<br>
She who had fainted with her fear,<br>
Rejoiced when waking she espies<br>
The Child; when she can trust her eyes,<br>
  And touches the blind Boy.<br><br>

She led him home, and wept amain,<br>
When he was in the house again:<br>
Tears flowed in torrents from her eyes;<br>
She kissed him&mdash;how could she chastise?<br>
  She was too happy far.<br><br>

Thus, after he had fondly braved<br>
The perilous Deep, the Boy was saved;<br>
And, though his fancies had been wild,<br>
Yet he was pleased and reconciled<br>
  To live in peace on shore. <br><br>

And in the lonely Highland dell<br>
Still do they keep the Turtle-shell;<br>
And long the story will repeat<br>
Of the blind Boy's adventurous feat,<br>
  And how he was preserved.<br>

Wordsworth sent him this stanza of the poem, and asked</span>

<a name="122n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; It is recorded in Dampier's Voyages that a Boy, the Son of a Captain of
a Man of War, seated himself in a Turtle-shell and floated in it from
the shore to his Father's Ship, which lay at anchor at the distance of
half a mile. Upon the suggestion of a Friend, I have substituted such a
Shell for that less elegant vessel in which my blind voyager did
actually intrust himself to the dangerous current of Loch Levin, as was
related to me by an Eye-witness.&mdash;W. W. 1815.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">This note varies slightly in later editions.<br>
<br>
The Loch Leven referred to is a sea-loch in Argyllshire, into which the
tidal water flows with some force from Loch Linnhe at Ballachulish.</span>

           <blockquote> 'By night and day<br>
  The great Sea-water finds its way<br>
  Through long, long windings of the hills.'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The friend referred to in the note of 1815, who urged Wordsworth to give
his blind voyager a Shell, instead of a washing-tub to sail in, was
Coleridge. The original tale of the tub was not more unfortunate than
the lines in praise of Wilkinson's spade, and several of Wordsworth's
friends, notably Charles Lamb and Barren Field, objected to the change.
Lamb wrote to Wordsworth in 1815,</span>

 <blockquote> "I am afraid lest that substitution of a shell (a flat falsification
  of the history) for the household implement, as it stood at first, was
  a kind of tub thrown out to the beast" [<i>i. e.</i> the reviewer!] "or
  rather thrown out for him. The tub was a good honest tub in its place,
  and nothing could fairly be said against it. You say you made the
  alteration for the 'friendly reader,' but the 'malicious' will take it
  to himself."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">(<i>The Letters of Charles Lamb</i>, edited by Alfred Ainger, vol. i. p.
283.) Wordsworth could not be induced to "undo his work," and go back to
his own original; although he evidently agreed with what Lamb had said
(as is seen in a letter to Barren Field, Oct. 24, 1828).&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

in Scotland</i>, 1803:</span>

  <blockquote>"Thursday, September 8th.&mdash;Before breakfast we walked to the Pass of
  Killicrankie. A very fine scene; the river Garry forcing its way down
  a deep chasm between rocks, at the foot of high rugged hills covered
  with wood, to a great height. The pass did not, however, impress us
  with awe, or a sensation of difficulty or danger, according to our
  expectations; but, the road being at a considerable height on the side
  of the hill, we at first only looked into the dell or chasm. It is
  much grander seen from below, near the river's bed. Everybody knows
  that this Pass is famous in military history. When we were travelling
  in Scotland, an invasion was hourly looked for, and one could not but
  think with some regret of the times when, from the now depopulated
  Highlands forty or fifty thousand men might have been poured down for
  the defence of the country, under such leaders as the Marquis of
  Montrose or the brave man who had so distinguished himself upon the
  ground where we were standing. I will transcribe a sonnet suggested to
  William by this place, and written in Oct. 1803."</blockquote>

victory; because, since the Norman conquest, no "Invaders" have ever set
foot "on British ground." It was written&mdash;like the two preceding
sonnets, and the one that follows it&mdash;"in anticipation" of Napoleon's
project for the invasion of England being actually carried out; a
project never realised. The assembling of the immense French army
destined for this purpose&mdash;one of the finest brought together since the
days of the Roman legions&mdash;between the mouths of the Seine and the
Texel, roused the spirit of English patriotism as it had never been
roused before. Three hundred thousand volunteers were enlisted in Great
Britain by the 10th of August 1803;</span>

  <blockquote>"all the male population of the kingdom from seventeen years of age to
  fifty-five were divided into classes to be successively armed and
  exercised" (Dyer).</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The story of the failure of Napoleon's scheme is too well known to be
repeated in this note. Wordsworth seems to have written his sonnet in
anticipation of what he believed would have been the inevitable issue of
events, had the French army actually landed on British soil.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
