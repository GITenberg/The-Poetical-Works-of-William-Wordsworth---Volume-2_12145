<br>
By Persons resident in the country and attached to rural objects, many
places will be found unnamed or of unknown names, where little Incidents
will have occurred, or feelings been experienced, which will have given
to such places a private and peculiar interest. From a wish to give some
sort of record to such Incidents or renew the gratification of such
Feelings, Names have been given to Places by the Author and some of his
Friends, and the following Poems written in consequence<a href="#33A"><sup>A</sup></a>.&mdash;W. W. 1800.<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
<a name="33A"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote A:</span></a> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">It should be explained that owing to the chronological plan
adopted in this edition (see the preface to vol. i.), two of the poems
which were placed by Wordsworth in his series of "Poems on the Naming of
Places," but which belong to later years, are printed in subsequent
volumes.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<h2><a name="section34"></a>"It was an April morning: fresh and clear"</h2>

<h4>Composed 1800.&mdash;Published 1800</h4>

<span style="color: #663300;">[Written at Grasmere. This poem was suggested on the banks of the brook
that runs through Easdale, which is, in some parts of its course, as
wild and beautiful as brook can be. I have composed thousands of verses
by the side of it.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>

<td>It was an April morning: fresh and clear<br>
The Rivulet, delighting in its strength,<br>
Ran with a young man's speed; and yet the voice<br>
Of waters which the winter had supplied<br>
Was softened down into a vernal tone.                       <br>
The spirit of enjoyment and desire,<br>
And hopes and wishes, from all living things<br>
Went circling, like a multitude of sounds.<br>
The budding groves seemed eager to urge on<br>
The steps of June; as if their various hues                 <br>
Were only hindrances that stood between<br>
Them and their object: but, meanwhile, prevailed<br>
Such an entire contentment in the air<br>
That every naked ash, and tardy tree<br>
Yet leafless, showed as if the countenance             <br>
With which it looked on this delightful day<br>
Were native to the summer.&mdash;Up the brook<br>
I roamed in the confusion of my heart,<br>
Alive to all things and forgetting all.<br>
At length I to a sudden turning came                       <br>
In this continuous glen, where down a rock<br>
The Stream, so ardent in its course before,<br>
Sent forth such sallies of glad sound, that all<br>
Which I till then had heard, appeared the voice<br>
Of common pleasure: beast and bird, the lamb,              <br>
The shepherd's dog, the linnet and the thrush<br>
Vied with this waterfall, and made a song,<br>
Which, while I listened, seemed like the wild growth<br>
Or like some natural produce of the air,<br>
That could not cease to be. Green leaves were here;        <br>
But 'twas the foliage of the rocks&mdash;the birch,<br>
The yew, the holly, and the bright green thorn,<br>
With hanging islands of resplendent furze:<br>
And, on a summit, distant a short space,<br>
By any who should look beyond the dell,                    <br>
A single mountain-cottage might be seen.<br>
I gazed and gazed, and to myself I said,<br>
"Our thoughts at least are ours; and this wild nook,<br>
My <b>Emma</b>, I will dedicate to thee."<br>
&mdash;Soon did the spot become my other home,                  <br>
My dwelling, and my out-of-doors abode.<br>
And, of the Shepherds who have seen me there,<br>
To whom I sometimes in our idle talk<br>
Have told this fancy, two or three, perhaps,<br>
Years after we are gone and in our graves,                 <br>
When they have cause to speak of this wild place,<br>
May call it by the name of <b>Emma's Dell</b>.<br>

<a name="34n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">The text of the "Poems on the Naming of Places" underwent comparatively
little alteration in successive editions. Both the changes in the first
poem were made in 1845. From the Fenwick note, it is evident that "the
Rivulet" was Easdale beck. But where was "Emma's Dell"? In the autumn of
1877, Dr. Cradock, the Principal of Brasenose College, Oxford, took me
to a place, of which he afterwards wrote, </span>

<blockquote>"I have a fancy for a spot just beyond Goody Bridge to the left, where
  the brook makes a curve, and returns to the road two hundred yards
  farther on. But I have not discovered a trace of authority in favour
  of the idea farther than that the wooded bend of the brook with the
  stepping stones across it, connected with a field-path recently
  stopped, was a very favourite haunt of Wordsworth's. At the upper part
  of this bend, near to the place where the brook returns to the road,
  is a deep pool at the foot of a rush of water. In this pool, a man
  named Wilson was drowned many years ago. He lived at a house on the
  hill called Score Crag, which, if my conjecture as to Emma's Dell is
  right, is the 'single mountain cottage' on a 'summit, distant a short
  space.' Wordsworth, happening to be walking at no great distance,
  heard a loud shriek. It was that of Mr. Wilson, the father, who had
  just discovered his son's body in the beck."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">In the "Reminiscences" of the poet, by the Hon. Mr. Justice Coleridge,
which were contributed to the <i>Memoirs of Wordsworth</i>, written by his
nephew (vol. ii. pp. 300-315), there is a record of a walk they took up
Easdale to this place, entering the field just at the spot which Dr.
Cradock supposes to be "Emma's Dell."</span> 

<blockquote>"He turned aside at a little farm-house, and took us into a swelling
  field to look down on the tumbling stream which bounded it, and which
  we saw precipitated at a distance, in a broad white sheet, from the
  mountain." (This refers to Easdale Force.) "Then, as he mused for an
  instant, he said,

   <blockquote> 'I have often thought what a solemn thing it would be could we have
    brought to our mind at once all the scenes of distress and misery
    which any spot, however beautiful and calm before us, has been
    witness to since the beginning. That water break, with the glassy
    quiet pool beneath it, that looks so lovely, and presents no images
    to the mind but of peace&mdash;there, I remember, the only son of his
    father, a poor man who lived yonder, was drowned.'"</blockquote></blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">This walk and conversation took place in October 1836. If any one is
surprised that Wordsworth, supposing him to have been then looking into
the very dell on which he wrote the above poem in 1800, did not name it
to Mr. Coleridge, he must remember that he was not in the habit of
speaking of the places he had memorialised in verse, and that in 1836
his "Sister Emmeline" had for a year been a confirmed invalid at Rydal.
I have repeatedly followed Easdale beck all the way up from its junction
with the Rothay to the Tarn, and found no spot corresponding so closely
to the realistic detail of this poem as the one suggested by Dr.
Cradock. There are two places further up the dale where the "sallies of
glad sound" such as are referred to in the poem, are even more
distinctly audible; but they are not at "a sudden turning," as is the
spot above Goody Bridge. If one leaves the Easdale road at this bridge,
and keeps to the side of the beck for a few hundred yards, till he
reaches the turning, &mdash;especially if it be a bright April morning, such
as that described in the poem,&mdash;and remembers that this path by the
brook was a favourite resort of Wordsworth and his sister, the
probability of Dr. Cradock's suggestion will be apparent. Lady
Richardson, who knew the place, and appreciated the poem as thoroughly
as any of Wordsworth's friends, told me that she concurred in this
identification of the "dell."&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<span style="color: #663300;">[Written at Grasmere. The effect of her laugh is an extravagance, though
the effect of the reverberation of voices in some parts of the mountains
is very striking. There is, in <i>The Excursion</i>, an allusion to the
bleat of a lamb thus re-echoed, and described without any exaggeration,
as I heard it, on the side of Stickle Tarn, from the precipice that
stretches on to Langdale Pikes.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>

<td>Amid the smoke of cities did you pass<br>
The time of early youth; and there you learned,<br>
From years of quiet industry, to love<br>
The living Beings by your own fire-side,<br>
With such a strong devotion, that your heart                    <br>
Is slow to meet the sympathies of them<br>
Who look upon the hills with tenderness,<br>
And make dear friendships with the streams and groves.<br>
Yet we, who are transgressors in this kind,                    <br>
Dwelling retired in our simplicity                             <br>
Among the woods and fields, we love you well,<br>
Joanna! and I guess, since you have been<br>
So distant from us now for two long years,<br>
That you will gladly listen to discourse,<br>
However trivial, if you thence be taught                   <br>
That they, with whom you once were happy, talk<br>
Familiarly of you and of old times.<br><br>

  While I was seated, now some ten days past,<br>
Beneath those lofty firs, that overtop<br>
Their ancient neighbour, the old steeple-tower,                <br>
The Vicar from his gloomy house hard by<br>
Came forth to greet me; and when he had asked,<br>
"How fares Joanna, that wild-hearted Maid!<br>
And when will she return to us?" he paused;<br>
And, after short exchange of village news,                     <br>
He with grave looks demanded, for what cause,<br>
Reviving obsolete idolatry,<br>
I, like a Runic Priest, in characters<br>
Of formidable size had chiselled out<br>
Some uncouth name upon the native rock,                        <br>
Above the Rotha, by the forest-side.<br>
&mdash;Now, by those dear immunities of heart<br>
Engendered between malice and true love,<br>
I was not loth to be so catechised,<br>
And this was my reply:&mdash;"As it befel,                          <br>
One summer morning we had walked abroad<br>
At break of day, Joanna and myself.<br>
&mdash;'Twas that delightful season when the broom,<br>
Full-flowered, and visible on every steep,<br>
Along the copses runs in veins of gold.                        <br>
Our pathway led us on to Rotha's banks;<br>
And when we came in front of that tall rock<br>
That eastward looks, I there stopped short&mdash;and stood<br>
Tracing the lofty barrier with my eye<br>
From base to summit; such delight I found                      <br>
To note in shrub and tree, in stone and flower<br>
That intermixture of delicious hues,<br>
Along so vast a surface, all at once,<br>
In one impression, by connecting force<br>
Of their own beauty, imaged in the heart.                      <br>
&mdash;When I had gazed perhaps two minutes' space,<br>
Joanna, looking in my eyes, beheld<br>
That ravishment of mine, and laughed aloud.<br>
The Rock, like something starting from a sleep,<br>
Took up the Lady's voice, and laughed again;                   <br>
That ancient Woman seated on Helm-crag<br>
Was ready with her cavern; Hammar-scar,<br>
And the tall Steep of Silver-how, sent forth<br>
A noise of laughter; southern Loughrigg heard,<br>
And Fairfield answered with a mountain tone;                   <br>
Helvellyn far into the clear blue sky<br>
Carried the Lady's voice,&mdash;old Skiddaw blew<br>
His speaking-trumpet;&mdash;back out of the clouds<br>
Of Glaramara southward came the voice;<br>
And Kirkstone tossed it from his misty head.                   <br>
&mdash;Now whether (said I to our cordial Friend,<br>
Who in the hey-day of astonishment<br>
Smiled in my face) this were in simple truth<br>
A work accomplished by the brotherhood<br>
Of ancient mountains, or my ear was touched                    <br>
With dreams and visionary impulses<br>
To me alone imparted, sure I am<br>
That there was a loud uproar in the hills.<br>
And, while we both were listening, to my side<br>
The fair Joanna drew, as if she wished                         <br>
To shelter from some object of her fear.<br>
&mdash;And hence, long afterwards, when eighteen moons<br>
Were wasted, as I chanced to walk alone<br>
Beneath this rock, at sunrise, on a calm<br>
And silent morning, I sat down, and there,                     <br>
In memory of affections old and true,<br>
I chiselled out in those rude characters<br>
Joanna's name deep in the living stone:&mdash;<br>
And I, and all who dwell by my fireside,<br>
Have called the lovely rock, <b>Joanna's Rock</b>."                   <br>

<a name="35n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; In Cumberland and Westmoreland are several Inscriptions upon the native
rock which from the wasting of Time and the rudeness of the Workmanship
had been mistaken for Runic. They are without doubt Roman.<br>
<br>
The Rotha, mentioned in this poem, is the River which flowing through
the Lakes of Grasmere and Rydale falls into Wyndermere. On Helm-Crag,
that impressive single Mountain at the head of the Vale of Grasmere, is
a Rock which from most points of view bears a striking resemblance to an
Old Woman cowering. Close by this rock is one of those Fissures or
Caverns, which in the language of the Country are called Dungeons. The
other Mountains either immediately surround the Vale of Grasmere, or
belong to the same Cluster.&mdash;W. W. 1800.<br>
<br>
Most of the Mountains here mentioned immediately surround the vale of
Grasmere; of the others, some are at a considerable distance, but they
belong to the same cluster.&mdash; W. W. 1802.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">The majority of the changes introduced into the text of this poem were
made in the year 1836.<br>
<br>
The place where the echo of the bleat of the lamb was heard &mdash;referred
to in the Fenwick note&mdash;may be easily found. The "precipice" is Pavy
Ark. "The 'lofty firs, that overtop their ancient neighbour, the old
steeple-tower,' stood by the roadside, scarcely twenty yards north-west
from the steeple of Grasmere church. Their site is now included in the
road, which has been widened at that point. They were Scotch firs of
unusual size, and might justly be said to 'overtop their neighbour' the
tower. Mr. Fleming Green, who well remembers the trees, gave me this
information, which is confirmed by other inhabitants. </span>

<blockquote>"When the road was enlarged, not many years ago, the roots of the
  trees were found by the workmen." </blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">(Dr. Cradock to the editor.) The</span>

<blockquote>'tall rock<br>
    That eastward looks'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">by the banks of the Rotha, presenting a "lofty barrier" "from base to
summit," is manifestly a portion of Helmcrag. It is impossible to know
whether Wordsworth carved Joanna Hutchinson's name anywhere on Helmcrag,
and it is useless to enquire. If he did so, the discovery of the place
would not help any one to understand or appreciate the poem. It is
obvious that he did not intend to be literally exact in details, as the
poem was written in 1800, and addressed to Joanna Hutchinson,&mdash;who is
spoken of as having been absent from Grasmere "for two long years;" and
Wordsworth says that he carved the Runic characters <i>in memoriam</i>
eighteen months after that summer morning when he heard the echo of her
laugh. But the family took up residence at Grasmere only in December
1799, and the "Poems on the Naming of Places" were published before the
close of 1800. The effect of these lines to Joanna, however, is
certainly not impaired&mdash;it may even be enhanced&mdash;by our inability to
localise them. Only one in the list of places referred to can occasion
any perplexity, <i>viz.</i>, Hammar-scar, since it is a name now disused in the
district. It used to be applied to some rocks on the flank of
Silver-how, to the wood around them, and also to the gorge between
Silver-how and Loughrigg. Hammar, from the old Norse <i>hamar</i>, signifies
a steep broken rock.<br>
<br>
The imaginative description of the echo of the lady's laugh suggests a
parallel passage from Michael Drayton's <i>Polyolbion</i>, which Wordsworth
must doubtless have read. (See his sister's reference to Drayton in her
<i>Recollections of a Tour made in Scotland</i>, in 1803: in the <a href="Wordsworth2g.html#109n1">note</a> to the
poem, <i>At the grave of Burns</i>, p. 382 of this volume.)</span>

<blockquote>Which <i>Copland</i> scarce had spoke, but quickly every Hill<br>
Upon her verge that stands, the neighbouring valleys fill;<br>
<i>Helvillon</i> from his height, it through the mountains threw,<br>
From whence as soon again, the sound <i>Dunbalrase</i> drew,<br>
From whose stone-troph&egrave;d head, it on the <i>Wendrosse</i> went,<br>
Which tow'rds the sea again, resounded it to <i>Dent</i>,<br>
That <i>Brodwater</i> therewith within her banks astound,<br>
In sailing to the sea, told it to <i>Egremound</i>,<br>
Whose buildings, walks, and streets, with echoes loud and long,<br>
Did mightily commend old <i>Copland</i> for her song.</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;"><i>Polyolbion</i>, The Thirtieth Song, ll. 155-164.


Any one who compares this passage with Wordsworth's <i>Joanna</i> will see
the difference between the elaborate fancy of a topographical narrator,
and the vivid imagination of a poetical idealist. A somewhat similar
instance of indebtedness&mdash;in which the debt is repaid by additional
insight&mdash;is seen when we compare a passage from Sir John Davies's
<i>Orchestra, or a poem on Dancing</i> (stanza 49), with one from <i>The
Ancient Mariner</i>, Part VI. stanzas 2 and 3&mdash;although there was more of
the true imaginative light in Davies than in Drayton.</span>

<blockquote>For lo, the sea that fleets about the land,<br>
  And like a girdle clips her solid waist,<br>
Music and measure both doth understand;<br>
  For his great crystal eye is always cast<br>
  Up to the moon, and on her fixed fast:<br>
    And as she danceth in her palid sphere<br>
    So danceth he about his centre here.  </blockquote> 

<b>Davies</b>.<br>


<blockquote>Still as a slave before his lord,<br>
    The ocean hath no blast;<br>
    His great bright eye most silently<br>
    Up to the moon is cast&mdash;<br><br>

    If he may know which way to go;<br>
    For she guides him smooth or grim.<br>
    See, brother, see! how graciously<br>
    She looketh down on him.</blockquote>

<b>Coleridge</b>.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">These extracts show how both Wordsworth and Coleridge assimilated past
literary products, and how they glorified them by reproduction. There
was little, however, in the poetic imagery of previous centuries that
Wordsworth reproduced. His imagination worked in a sphere of its own,
free from the trammels of precedent; and he was more original than any
other nineteenth century poet in his use of symbol and metaphor. The
poem <i>To Joanna</i> was probably composed on August 22, 1800, as the
following occurs in Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Journal</i> under that date:</span>

 <blockquote> "William was composing all the morning ... W. read us the poem of
  Joanna, beside the Rothay, by the roadside."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Charles Lamb wrote to Wordsworth in January 1801, of</span>

 <blockquote> "these continuous echoes in the story of 'Joanna's laugh,' when the
  mountains and all the scenery seem absolutely alive."</blockquote>

<td>A narrow girdle of rough stones and crags,<br>
A rude and natural causeway, interposed<br>
Between the water and a winding slope<br>
Of copse and thicket, leaves the eastern shore<br>
Of Grasmere safe in its own privacy:                     <br>
And there myself and two belov&egrave;d Friends,<br>
One calm September morning, ere the mist<br>
Had altogether yielded to the sun,<br>
Sauntered on this retired and difficult way.<br>
&mdash;Ill suits the road with one in haste; but we              <br>
Played with our time; and, as we strolled along,<br>
It was our occupation to observe<br>
Such objects as the waves had tossed ashore&mdash;<br>
Feather, or leaf, or weed, or withered bough,<br>
Each on the other heaped, along the line                    <br>
Of the dry wreck. And, in our vacant mood,<br>
Not seldom did we stop to watch some tuft<br>
Of dandelion seed or thistle's beard,<br>
That skimmed the surface of the dead calm lake,<br>
Suddenly halting now&mdash;a lifeless stand!                     <br>
And starting off again with freak as sudden;<br>
In all its sportive wanderings, all the while,<br>
Making report of an invisible breeze<br>
That was its wings, its chariot, and its horse,<br>
Its playmate, rather say, its moving soul.              <br>
&mdash;And often, trifling with a privilege<br>
Alike indulged to all, we paused, one now,<br>
And now the other, to point out, perchance<br>
To pluck, some flower or water-weed, too fair<br>
Either to be divided from the place                         <br>
On which it grew, or to be left alone<br>
To its own beauty. Many such there are,<br>
Fair ferns and flowers, and chiefly that tall fern,<br>
So stately, of the queen Osmunda named;<br>
Plant lovelier, in its own retired abode                    <br>
On Grasmere's beach, than Naiad by the side<br>
Of Grecian brook, or Lady of the Mere,<br>
Sole-sitting by the shores of old romance.<br>
&mdash;So fared we that bright morning: from the fields,<br>
Meanwhile, a noise was heard, the busy mirth                <br>
Of reapers, men and women, boys and girls.<br>
Delighted much to listen to those sounds,<br>
And feeding thus our fancies, we advanced     <br>
Along the indented shore; when suddenly,<br>
Through a thin veil of glittering haze was seen           <br>
Before us, on a point of jutting land,<br>
The tall and upright figure of a Man<br>
Attired in peasant's garb, who stood alone,<br>
Angling beside the margin of the lake.<br>
"Improvident and reckless," we exclaimed,                   <br>
"The Man must be, who thus can lose a day<br>
Of the mid harvest, when the labourer's hire<br>
Is ample, and some little might be stored<br>
Wherewith to cheer him in the winter time."<br>
Thus talking of that Peasant, we approached                 <br>
Close to the spot where with his rod and line<br>
He stood alone; whereat he turned his head<br>
To greet us&mdash;and we saw a Man worn down<br>
By sickness, gaunt and lean, with sunken cheeks<br>
And wasted limbs, his legs so long and lean                 <br>
That for my single self I looked at them,<br>
Forgetful of the body they sustained.&mdash;<br>
Too weak to labour in the harvest field,<br>
The Man was using his best skill to gain<br>
A pittance from the dead unfeeling lake                     <br>
That knew not of his wants. I will not say<br>
What thoughts immediately were ours, nor how<br>
The happy idleness of that sweet morn,<br>
With all its lovely images, was changed<br>
To serious musing and to self-reproach.                     <br>
Nor did we fail to see within ourselves<br>
What need there is to be reserved in speech,<br>
And temper all our thoughts with charity.<br>
&mdash;Therefore, unwilling to forget that day,<br>
My Friend, Myself, and She who then received                <br>
The same admonishment, have called the place<br>
By a memorial name, uncouth indeed<br>
As e'er by mariner was given to bay<br>
Or foreland, on a new-discovered coast;<br>
And <b>Point Rash-Judgment</b> is the name it bears.               <br>

<a name="37n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">The text of this poem reached its final state in the edition of 1827.
The same is true of the poem which follows, <i>To M. H.</i>, with the
exception of a single change.<br>
<br>
In Wordsworth's early days at Grasmere, a wild woodland path of quiet
beauty led from Dove Cottage along the margin of the lake to the "Point"
referred to in this poem, leaving the eastern shore truly "safe in its
own privacy"&mdash;a "retired and difficult way"; the high-way road for
carriages being at that time over White Moss Common. The late Dr.
Arnold, of Rugby and Foxhowe, used to name the three roads from Rydal to
Grasmere thus: the highest, "Old Corruption"; the intermediate, "Bit by
bit Reform"; the lowest and most level, "Radical Reform." Wordsworth was
never quite reconciled to the radical reform effected on a road that
used to be so delightfully wild and picturesque. The spot which the
three friends rather infelicitously named "Point Rash-Judgment" is
easily identified; although, as Wordsworth remarks, the character of the
shore is changed by the public road being carried along its side. The
friends were quite aware that the "memorial name" they gave it was
"uncouth." In spite of its awkwardness, however, it will probably
survive; if not for Browning's reason</span>

<blockquote>The better the uncouther;<br>
Do roses stick like burrs?</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">at least because of the incident which gave rise to the poem.
The date of composition is fixed by Dorothy Wordsworth's
<i>Journal</i>, </span>

  <blockquote>"10th Oct. 1800, Wm. sat up after me, writing <i>Point
  Rash-Judgment.</i>"</blockquote>

<td>Our walk was far among the ancient trees:<br>
There was no road, nor any woodman's path;<br>
But a thick umbrage&mdash;checking the wild growth<br>
Of weed and sapling, along soft green turf<br>
Beneath the branches&mdash;of itself had made<br>
A track, that brought us to a slip of lawn,<br>
And a small bed of water in the woods.<br>
All round this pool both flocks and herds might drink<br>
On its firm margin, even as from a well,<br>
Or some stone-basin which the herdsman's hand<br>
Had shaped for their refreshment; nor did sun,<br>
Or wind from any quarter, ever come,<br>
But as a blessing to this calm recess,<br>
This glade of water and this one green field.<br>
The spot was made by Nature for herself;<br>
The travellers know it not, and 'twill remain<br>
Unknown to them; but it is beautiful;<br>
And if a man should plant his cottage near,<br>
Should sleep beneath the shelter of its trees,<br>
And blend its waters with his daily meal,<br>
He would so love it, that in his death-hour<br>
Its image would survive among his thoughts:<br>
And therefore, my sweet <b>Mary</b>, this still Nook,<br>
With all its beeches, we have named from You!<br>

<br>
<a name="38n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">To find the pool referred to in the Fenwick note, I have carefully
examined the course of Rydal beck, all the way up to the foot of the
Fell. There is a pool beyond the enclosures of the Hall property, about
five hundred feet above Rydal Mount, which partly corresponds to the
description in the poem, but there is no wood around it now; and the
trees which skirt its margin are birch, ash, oak, and hazel, but there
are no beeches. It is a short way below some fine specimens of ice-worn
rocks, which are to the right of the stream as you ascend it, and above
these rocks is a well-marked moraine. It is a deep crystal pool, and has
a "firm margin" of (artificially placed) stones. This may be the spot
described in the poem; or another, within the grounds of the Hall, may
be the place referred to. It is a sequestered nook, beside the third
waterfall as you ascend the beck&mdash;this third cascade being itself a
treble fall. Seen two or three days after rain, when the stream is full
enough to break over the whole face of the rock in showers of snowy
brightness, yet low enough to shew the rock behind its transparent veil,
it is specially beautiful. Trees change so much in eighty years that the
absence of "beeches" now would not make this site impossible. In a MS.
copy of the poem (of date Dec. 28, 1800), the last line is</span>

<blockquote>'With all its poplars, we have named from you.'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Of the circular pool beneath this fall it may be said, as Wordsworth
describes it, that</span>

<blockquote>'... both flocks and herds might drink<br>
  On its firm margin, even as from a well;'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">and a "small slip of lawn" might easily have existed there in his time.
We cannot, however, be confident as to the locality, and I add the
opinion of several, whose judgment may be deferred to. Dr. Cradock
writes:</span>


<blockquote>  "As to Mary Hutchinson's pool, I think that it was not on the beck
  anywhere, but some detached little pool, far up the hill, to the
  eastwards of the Hall, in 'the woods.' The description does not well
  suit any part of Rydal beck; and no spot thereon could long 'remain
  unknown,' as the brook was until lately much haunted by anglers."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">My difficulty as to a site "far up the hill" is, that it must have been
a pool of some size, if "both flocks and herds might drink" all round
it; and there is no stream, scarce even a rill that joins Rydal beck on
the right, all the way up from its junction with the Rothay. The late
Mr. Hull of Rydal Cottage, wrote:</span>

<blockquote>  "Although closely acquainted with every nook about Rydal Park, I have
  never been able to discover any spot corresponding to that described
  in Wordsworth's lines to M. H. It is possible, however, that the
  'small bed of water' may have been a temporary rain pool, such as
  sometimes lodges in the hollows on the mountain-slope after heavy
  rain."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Mr. F. M. Jones, the agent of the Rydal property, writes: </span>

<blockquote>  "I do not know of any pool of water in the Upper Rydal Park. There are
  some pools up the river, 'Mirror Pool' among them; but I hardly think
  there can ever have been 'beech-trees' growing near them."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">There are many difficulties, and the place cannot now be identified.
Wordsworth's own wish will doubtless be realised,</span>

<blockquote>'The travellers know it not, and 'twill remain<br>
  Unknown to them.' </blockquote>

<a name="39n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">The spot referred to in this poem can be identified with perfect
accuracy. The Eglantine grew on the little brook that runs past two
cottages (close to the path under Nab Scar), which have been built since
the poet's time, and are marked Brockstone on the Ordnance Map.</span>

 <blockquote> "The plant itself of course has long disappeared: but in following up
  the rill through the copse, above the cottages, I found an unusually
  large Eglantine, growing by the side of the stream."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">(Dr Cradock to the editor, in 1877.) It still grows luxuriantly there.<br>
<br>
The following extract from Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Journal</i> illustrates both
this and the next poem:</span>

<blockquote>  "Friday, 23rd April 1802.&mdash;It being a beautiful morning, we set off at
  eleven o'clock, intending to stay out of doors all the morning. We
  went towards Rydal, under Nab Scar. The sun shone and we were lazy.
  Coleridge pitched upon several places to sit down upon; but we could
  not be all of one mind respecting sun and shade, so we pushed on to
  the foot of the Scar. It was very grand when we looked up, very stony;
  here and there a budding tree. William observed that the umbrella
  Yew-tree that breasts the wind had lost its character as a tree, and
  had become like solid wood. Coleridge and I pushed on before. We left
  William sitting on the stones, feasting with silence, and I sat down
  upon a rocky seat, a couch it might be, under the Bower of William's
  'Eglantine,' 'Andrew's Broom.' He was below us, and we could see him.
  He came to us, and repeated his Poems, while we sat beside him. We
  lingered long, looking into the vales; Ambleside Vale, with the
  copses, the village under the hill, and the green fields; Rydale, with
  a lake all alive and glittering, yet but little stirred by breezes;
  and our own dear Grasmere, making a little round lake of Nature's own,
  with never a house, never a green field, but the copses and the bare
  hills enclosing it, and the river flowing out of it. Above rose the
  Coniston Fells, in their own shape and colour, ... the sky, and the
  clouds, and a few wild creatures. Coleridge went to search for
  something new. We saw him climbing up towards a rock. He called us,
  and we found him in a bower,&mdash;the sweetest that was ever seen. The
  rock on one side is very high, and all covered with ivy, which hung
  loosely about, and bore bunches of brown berries. On the other side,
  it was higher than my head. We looked down on the Ambleside vale, that
  seemed to wind away from us, the village lying under the hill. The fir
  tree island was reflected beautifully.... About this bower there is
  mountain-ash, common ash, yew tree, ivy, holly, hawthorn, roses,
  flowers, and a carpet of moss. Above at the top of the rock there is
  another spot. It is scarce a bower, a little parlour, not enclosed by
  walls, but shaped out for a resting-place by the rocks, and the ground
  rising about it. It had a sweet moss carpet. We resolved to go and
  plant flowers, in both these places to-morrow."</blockquote>

Headlong yon waterfall must come,<br>
Oh let it then be dumb!<br>
Be anything, sweet Rill, but that which thou art now.<br><br>

"Thou Eglantine, so bright with sunny showers,<br>
Proud as a rainbow spanning half the vale,<br>
Thou one fair shrub, oh! shed thy flowers,<br>
And stir not in the gale.<br>

To see thy arch thus stretch and bend,<br>
Thus rise and thus descend,&mdash;<br>
Disturbs me till the sight is more than I can bear."<br><br>

The Man who makes this feverish complaint<br>
Is one of giant stature, who could dance<br>
Equipped from head to foot in iron mail.<br>
Ah gentle Love! if ever thought was thine<br>
To store up kindred hours for me, thy face<br>
Turn from me, gentle Love! nor let me walk<br>
Within the sound of Emma's voice, nor know<br>
Such happiness as I have known to-day.<br>

without the first, the fifth, and the last, it would have been deemed an
exquisite fragment by those who object to the explanatory preamble, and
to the moralising sequel. The intermediate stanzas suggest Burns's</span>

<blockquote>'Ye banks and braes o' bonnie Doon,<br>
    How can ye bloom sae fresh and fair!<br>
  How can ye chant, ye little birds,<br>
    An' I sae weary, fu' o' care!'</blockquote>

 <span style="color: #555555;">and Browning's <i>May and Death</i>:</span>

<blockquote>'I wish that when you died last May,<br>
    Charles, there had died along with you<br>
  Three parts of spring's delightful things;<br>
    Ay, and, for me, the fourth part too.'</blockquote>
  
<span style="color: #555555;">This mood of mind Wordsworth appreciated as fully as the opposite, or
complementary one, which finds expression in the great <i>Ode, Intimations
of Immortality</i> (vol. viii.), l. 26.</span>

<blockquote>'No more shall grief of mine the season wrong,'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">and which Browning expresses in other verses of his lyric, and
repeatedly elsewhere. The allusion in the last stanza of this poem is to
Wordsworth's sister Dorothy.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

funeral took place without a basin filled with sprigs of boxwood being
placed upon a table covered with a white cloth in front of the house.
The huntings on foot, in which the old man is supposed to join as here
described, were of common, almost habitual, occurrence in our vales when
I was a boy, and the people took much delight in them. They are now less
frequent.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>

<td>These Tourists, heaven preserve us! needs must live<br>
A profitable life: some glance along,<br>
Rapid and gay, as if the earth were air,<br>
And they were butterflies to wheel about<br>
Long as the summer lasted: some, as wise,                   <br>
Perched on the forehead of a jutting crag,<br>
Pencil in hand and book upon the knee,<br>
Will look and scribble, scribble on and look,<br>

Why can he tarry <i>yonder</i>?&mdash;In our church-yard<br>

And a few natural graves."<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  To Jane, his wife,<br>
Thus spake the homely Priest of Ennerdale.<br>
It was a July evening; and he sate<br>
Upon the long stone-seat beneath the eaves                     <br>
Of his old cottage,&mdash;as it chanced, that day,<br>
Employed in winter's work. Upon the stone<br>
His wife sate near him, teasing matted wool,<br>
While, from the twin cards toothed with glittering wire,<br>
He fed the spindle of his youngest child,                      <br>
Who, in the open air, with due accord<br>
Of busy hands and back-and-forward steps,<br>
Her large round wheel was turning. Towards the field<br>
In which the Parish Chapel stood alone,<br>
Girt round with a bare ring of mossy wall,                     <br>
While half an hour went by, the Priest had sent<br>
Many a long look of wonder: and at last,<br>
Risen from his seat, beside the snow white ridge<br>
Of carded wool which the old man had piled<br>
He laid his implements with gentle care,                       <br>
Each in the other locked; and, down the path<br>
That from his cottage to the church-yard led,<br>
He took his way, impatient to accost<br>
The Stranger, whom he saw still lingering there.<br><br>

'Twas one well known to him in former days,                    <br>
A Shepherd-lad; who ere his sixteenth year<br>
Had left that calling, tempted to entrust<br>
His expectations to the fickle winds<br>
And perilous waters; with the mariners<br>
A fellow-mariner;&mdash;and so had fared                            <br>
Through twenty seasons; but he had been reared<br>
Among the mountains, and he in his heart<br>
Was half a shepherd on the stormy seas.<br>
Oft in the piping shrouds had Leonard heard<br>
The tones of waterfalls, and inland sounds                     <br>
Of caves and trees:&mdash;and, when the regular wind<br>
Between the tropics filled the steady sail,<br>
And blew with the same breath through days and weeks,<br>
Lengthening invisibly its weary line<br>
Along the cloudless Main, he, in those hours                   <br>
Of tiresome indolence, would often hang<br>
Over the vessel's side, and gaze and gaze;<br>
And, while the broad blue wave and sparkling foam<br>
Flashed round him images and hues that wrought<br>
In union with the employment of his heart,                     <br>
He, thus by feverish passion overcome,<br>
Even with the organs of his bodily eye,<br>
Below him, in the bosom of the deep,<br>
Saw mountains; saw the forms of sheep that grazed<br>
On verdant hills&mdash;with dwellings among trees,                  <br>
And shepherds clad in the same country grey<br>
Which he himself had worn.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now, at last,<br>
From perils manifold, with some small wealth<br>
Acquired by traffic 'mid the Indian Isles,                 <br>
To his paternal home he is returned,<br>
With a determined purpose to resume<br>
The life he had lived there; both for the sake<br>
Of many darling pleasures, and the love<br>
Which to an only brother he has borne                          <br>
In all his hardships, since that happy time<br>
When, whether it blew foul or fair, they two<br>
Were brother-shepherds on their native hills.<br>
&mdash;They were the last of all their race: and now,<br>
When Leonard had approached his home, his heart                <br>
Failed in him; and, not venturing to enquire<br>
Tidings of one so long and dearly loved,<br>
He to the solitary church-yard turned;<br>
That, as he knew in what particular spot<br>
His family were laid, he thence might learn                    <br>
If still his Brother lived, or to the file<br>
Another grave was added.&mdash;He had found<br>
Another grave,&mdash;near which a full half-hour<br>
He had remained; but, as he gazed, there grew<br>
Such a confusion in his memory,                                <br>
That he began to doubt; and even to hope<br>
That he had seen this heap of turf before,&mdash;<br>
That it was not another grave; but one<br>
He had forgotten. He had lost his path,<br>
As up the vale, that afternoon, he walked                <br>
Through fields which once had been well known to him:<br>
And oh what joy this recollection now<br>
Sent to his heart! he lifted up his eyes,<br>
And, looking round, imagined that he saw<br>
Strange alteration wrought on every side                      <br>
Among the woods and fields, and that the rocks,<br>
And everlasting hills themselves were changed.<br><br>

By this the Priest, who down the field had come,<br>
Unseen by Leonard, at the church-yard gate<br>
Stopped short,&mdash;and thence, at leisure, limb by limb          <br>
Perused him with a gay complacency.<br>
Ay, thought the Vicar, smiling to himself,<br>
'Tis one of those who needs must leave the path<br>
Of the world's business to go wild alone:<br>
His arms have a perpetual holiday;                            <br>
The happy man will creep about the fields,<br>
Following his fancies by the hour, to bring<br>
Tears down his cheek, or solitary smiles<br>
Into his face, until the setting sun<br>
Write fool upon his forehead.&mdash;Planted thus                   <br>
Beneath a shed that over-arched the gate<br>
Of this rude church-yard, till the stars appeared<br>
The good Man might have communed with himself,<br>
But that the Stranger, who had left the grave,<br>
Approached; he recognised the Priest at once,                 <br>
And, after greetings interchanged, and given<br>
By Leonard to the Vicar as to one<br>
Unknown to him, this dialogue ensued.</td>

That does not play you false.&mdash;On that tall pike<br>
(It is the loneliest place of all these hills)                <br>

Though from the cradle they had lived with Walter,            <br>
The only kinsman near them, and though he<br>
Inclined to both by reason of his age,<br>
With a more fond, familiar, tenderness;<br>
They, notwithstanding, had much love to spare,<br>
And it all went into each other's hearts.                     <br>
Leonard, the elder by just eighteen months,<br>
Was two years taller: 'twas a joy to see,<br>
To hear, to meet them!&mdash;From their house the school<br>
Is distant three short miles, and in the time<br>
Of storm and thaw, when every water-course                    <br>
And unbridged stream, such as you may have noticed<br>
Crossing our roads at every hundred steps,<br>
Was swoln into a noisy rivulet<br>
Would Leonard then, when elder boys remained<br>
At home, go staggering through the slippery fords,       <br>
Bearing his brother on his back. I have seen him,<br>
On windy days, in one of those stray brooks,<br>
Ay, more than once I have seen him, mid-leg deep,<br>
Their two books lying both on a dry stone,<br>
Upon the hither side: and once I said,                        <br>
As I remember, looking round these rocks<br>
And hills on which we all of us were born,<br>
That God who made the great book of the world<br>
Would bless such piety&mdash;</td>

Leonard had never handled rope or shroud:                     <br>
For the boy loved the life which we lead here;<br>
And though of unripe years, a stripling only,<br>
His soul was knit to this his native soil.<br>
But, as I said, old Walter was too weak<br>
To strive with such a torrent; when he died,                  <br>
The estate and house were sold; and all their sheep,<br>
A pretty flock, and which, for aught I know,<br>
Had clothed the Ewbanks for a thousand years:&mdash;<br>
Well&mdash;all was gone, and they were destitute,<br>
And Leonard, chiefly for his Brother's sake,                  <br>
Resolved to try his fortune on the seas.<br>
Twelve years are past since we had tidings from him.<br>
If there were one among us who had heard<br>
That Leonard Ewbank was come home again,<br>
From the Great Gavel, down by Leeza's banks,              <br>
And down the Enna, far as Egremont.<br>
The day would be a joyous festival;<br>
And those two bells of ours, which there you see&mdash;<br>
Hanging in the open air&mdash;but, O good Sir!<br>
This is sad talk&mdash;they'll never sound for him&mdash;               <br>
Living or dead.&mdash;When last we heard of him,<br>
He was in slavery among the Moors<br>
Upon the Barbary coast.&mdash;'Twas not a little<br>
That would bring down his spirit; and no doubt,<br>
Before it ended in his death, the Youth                  <br>
Was sadly crossed.&mdash;Poor Leonard! when we parted,<br>
He took me by the hand, and said to me,<br>
If e'er he should grow rich, he would return,<br>
To live in peace upon his father's land,<br>
And lay his bones among us. </td>

Of a vast building made of many crags;                   <br>

That rises like a column from the vale,<br>
Whence by our shepherds it is called, <b>The Pillar</b>.<br>
Upon its a&euml;ry summit crowned with heath,<br>

Lay stretched at ease; but, passing by the place<br>
On their return, they found that he was gone.<br>
No ill was feared; till one of them by chance<br>
Entering, when evening was far spent, the house<br>
Which at that time was James's home, there learned       <br>
That nobody had seen him all that day:<br>
The morning came, and still he was unheard of:<br>
The neighbours were alarmed, and to the brook<br>
Some hastened; some ran to the lake: ere noon<br>
They found him at the foot of that same rock                  <br>
Dead, and with mangled limbs. The third day after<br>
I buried him, poor Youth, and there he lies!</td>

Were with him:&mdash;his long absence, cherished hopes,<br>
And thoughts which had been his an hour before,               <br>
All pressed on him with such a weight, that now,<br>
This vale, where he had been so happy, seemed <br>
A place in which he could not bear to live:<br>
So he relinquished all his purposes.<br>
He travelled back to Egremont: and thence,               <br>
That night, he wrote a letter to the Priest,<br>
Reminding him of what had passed between them; <br>
And adding, with a hope to be forgiven,<br>
That it was from the weakness of his heart<br>
He had not dared to tell him who he was.                      <br>
This done, he went on shipboard, and is now<br>
A Seaman, a grey-headed Mariner.<br>

<a name="44n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">This poem illustrates the way in which Wordsworth's imagination worked
upon a minimum of fact, idealizing a simple story, and adding</span>

<blockquote>                             'the gleam,<br>
  The light that never was, on sea or land,<br>
  The consecration, and the Poet's dream.'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">It is the only poem of his referring to Ennerdale; but perhaps the chief
association with that dale, to those who visit it after becoming
acquainted with this poem, will be the fact that the brothers Ewbank
were supposed to have spent their youth under the shadow of the Pillar,
and Leonard to have had this conversation, on his return from sea, with
the venerable priest of Ennerdale. The district is described with all
that local accuracy which Wordsworth invariably showed in idealization.
The height whence James Ewbank is supposed to have fallen is not the
Pillar-Rock&mdash;a crag somewhat difficult to ascend, except by practised
climbers, and which has only been accessible since mountaineering became
an art and a passion to Englishmen. But, if we suppose the conversation
with the priest of Ennerdale to have taken place at the Bridge, below
the Lake&mdash;as that is the only place where there is both a hamlet and "a
churchyard"&mdash;the "precipice" will refer to the Pillar "Mountain." Both
are alluded to in the poem. The lines,</span>

<blockquote>You see yon precipice;&mdash;it wears the shape<br>
Of a vast building made of many crags;<br>
And in the midst is one particular rock<br>
That rises like a column from the vale,<br>
Whence by our shepherds it is called, <i>The Pillar</i>,</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">are definite enough. The great mass of the Pillar Mountain is first
referred to, and then the Rock which is a characteristic spur, halfway
up the mountain on its northern side. The "a&euml;ry summit crowned with
heath," however, on which "the loiterer" "lay stretched at ease," could
neither be the top of this "rock" nor the summit of the "mountain": not
the former, because there is no heath on it, and it would be impossible
for a weary man, loitering behind his companions, to ascend it to rest;
not the latter, because no one resting on the summit of the mountain
could be "not unnoticed by his comrades," and they would not pass that
way over the top of the mountain "on their return" to Ennerdale. This is
an instance, therefore, in which precise localization is impossible.
Probably Wordsworth did not know either that the pillar "rock" was bare
on the summit, or that it had never been ascended in 1800; and he
idealised it to suit his imaginative purpose. In connection with this
poem, a remark he made to the Hon. Mr. Justice Coleridge may be
recalled.</span>

<blockquote>  "He said there was some foundation in fact, however slight, for every
  poem he had written of a narrative kind; ... <i>The Brothers</i> was
  founded on a young shepherd, in his sleep, having fallen down a crag,
  his staff remaining suspended mid-way."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">(See the <i>Memoirs of Wordsworth</i>, by the late Bishop of Lincoln,
vol. ii. p. 305.) It should be added that the character of Leonard
Ewbank was drawn in large part from that of the poet's brother John&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<td>There's George Fisher, Charles Fleming, and Reginald Shore,<br>
Three rosy-cheeked school-boys, the highest not more<br>
Than the height of a counsellor's bag;<br>
To the top of <b>Great How</b> did it please them to climb:<br>
And there they built up, without mortar or lime,<br>
A Man on the peak of the crag.<br><br>

They built him of stones gathered up as they lay:<br>
They built him and christened him all in one day,<br>
An urchin both vigorous and hale;<br>
And so without scruple they called him Ralph Jones. <br>
Now Ralph is renowned for the length of his bones;<br>
The Magog of Legberthwaite dale.<br><br>

Just half a week after, the wind sallied forth,<br>
And, in anger or merriment, out of the north,<br>
Coming on with a terrible pother, <br>
From the peak of the crag blew the giant away.<br>
And what did these school-boys?&mdash;The very next day<br>
They went and they built up another.<br><br>

&mdash;Some little I've seen of blind boisterous works<br>
By Christian disturbers more savage than Turks,<br>
Spirits busy to do and undo:<br>
At remembrance whereof my blood sometimes will flag;<br>
Then, light-hearted Boys, to the top of the crag;<br>
And I'll build up a giant with you.<br>

<td>I marvel how Nature could ever find space<br>
For so many strange contrasts in one human face:<br>
There's thought and no thought, and there's paleness and bloom<br>
And bustle and sluggishness, pleasure and gloom.<br><br>

There's weakness, and strength both redundant and vain;<br>
Such strength as, if ever affliction and pain<br>
Could pierce through a temper that's soft to disease,<br>
Would be rational peace&mdash;a philosopher's ease.<br><br>

There's indifference, alike when he fails or succeeds,<br>
And attention full ten times as much as there needs;<br>
Pride where there's no envy, there's so much of joy;<br>
And mildness, and spirit both forward and coy.<br><br>

There's freedom, and sometimes a diffident stare<br>
Of shame scarcely seeming to know that she's there,<br>
There's virtue, the title it surely may claim,<br>
Yet wants heaven knows what to be worthy the name.<br><br>

This picture from nature may seem to depart,<br>
Yet the Man would at once run away with your heart;<br>
And I for five centuries right gladly would be<br>
Such an odd such a kind happy creature as he.<br>

Character, in the antithetical Manner</i>. It was omitted from all
subsequent editions till 1837. With this early friend, Robert Jones&mdash;a
fellow collegian at St. John's College, Cambridge&mdash;Wordsworth visited
the Continent (France and Switzerland), during the long vacation of
1790; and to him he dedicated the first edition of <i>Descriptive
Sketches</i>, in 1793. With him he also made a pedestrian tour in Wales in
1791. Jones afterwards became the incumbent of Soulderne, near
Deddington, in Oxfordshire; and Wordsworth described his parsonage there
in the sonnet, beginning "Where holy ground begins, unhallowed ends."

The text of this poem underwent so many changes, which are not easily
shown by the plan adopted throughout this edition&mdash;portions of the
earliest version of 1800 being abandoned and again adopted, and the
whole arrangement of the passages being altered&mdash;that it seems desirable
to append the entire text of 1800, and extensive parts of that of
subsequent years. The final text of 1832 is printed above.

one line of the text of 1800. The passage reads:

<a name="48n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp;<span style="color: #555555;"> The "shapeless heap of stones" in St. Herbert's Island, which were
"desolate ruins" in 1800, are even more "shapeless" and "desolate" now,
but they can easily be identified. The island is near the centre of the
lake, and is in area about four acres. The legend of St. Herbert dates
from the middle of the seventh century. The rector of Clifton,
Westmoreland, Dr. Robinson, writing in 1819, says:</span>

  <blockquote>"The remains of his hermitage are still visible, being built of stone
  and mortar, and formed into two apartments, one of which, about twenty
  feet long and sixteen feet wide, seems to have been his chapel; the
  other, of less dimensions, his cell. Near these ruins the late Sir
  Wilfred Lawson (to whose representative the island at present belongs)
  erected some years ago a small octagonal cottage, which, being built
  of unhewn stone, and artificially mossed over, has a venerable
  appearance."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">(See <i>Guide to the Lakes</i>, by John Robinson, D.D., 1819). This cottage
has now disappeared. The following version of this "Inscription" occurs
in a letter from Wordsworth to Lady Beaumont, dated 26th November 1811:</span>

  <blockquote>This Island, guarded from profane approach<br>
  By mountains high and waters widely spread,<br>
  Gave to St. Herbert a benign retreat.<br>
  Upon a staff supported, and his Brow<br>
  White with the peaceful diadem of age.<br>
  Hither he came&mdash;a self-secluded Man,<br>
  ...<br>
  Behold that shapeless Heap of stones and earth!<br>
  "Tis reverenced as a Vestige of the Abode<br>
  ...<br>
  ...      &mdash;And when within his Cell<br>
  Alone he knelt before the crucifix,</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">In a previous letter to Sir George Beaumont, dated 16th November 1811:</span>

  <blockquote>By mountains high and waters widely spread,<br>
  Is that Seclusion which St. Herbert chose;<br>
  ...<br>
  Hither he came in life's austere decline:<br>
  And, Stranger! this blank Heap of stones and earth<br>
  Is reverenced ...</blockquote>

<td>If from the public way you turn your steps<br>
Up the tumultuous brook of Green-head Ghyll,<br>
You will suppose that with an upright path<br>
Your feet must struggle; in such bold ascent<br>
The pastoral mountains front you, face to face.                     <br>
But, courage! for around that boisterous brook<br>
The mountains have all opened out themselves,<br>
And made a hidden valley of their own.<br>
No habitation can be seen; but they<br>
Who journey thither find themselves alone                      <br>
With a few sheep, with rocks and stones, and kites<br>
That overhead are sailing in the sky.<br>
It is in truth an utter solitude;<br>
Nor should I have made mention of this Dell<br>
But for one object which you might pass by,                        <br>
Might see and notice not. Beside the brook<br>
Appears a straggling heap of unhewn stones!<br>
And to that simple object appertains<br>
A story&mdash;unenriched with strange events,<br>
Yet not unfit, I deem, for the fireside,                       <br>
Or for the summer shade. It was the first<br>
Of those domestic tales that spake to me<br>
Of Shepherds, dwellers in the valleys, men<br>
Whom I already loved;&mdash;not verily<br>
For their own sakes, but for the fields and hills                  <br>
Where was their occupation and abode.<br>
And hence this Tale, while I was yet a Boy<br>
Careless of books, yet having felt the power<br>
Of Nature, by the gentle agency<br>
Of natural objects, led me on to feel                              <br>
For passions that were not my own, and think<br>
(At random and imperfectly indeed)<br>
On man, the heart of man, and human life.<br>
Therefore, although it be a history<br>
Homely and rude, I will relate the same                            <br>
For the delight of a few natural hearts;<br>
And, with yet fonder feeling, for the sake<br>
Of youthful Poets, who among these hills<br>
Will be my second self when I am gone.<br><br>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Upon the forest-side in Grasmere Vale                            <br>
There dwelt a Shepherd, Michael was his name;<br>
An old man, stout of heart, and strong of limb.<br>
His bodily frame had been from youth to age<br>
Of an unusual strength: his mind was keen,<br>
Intense, and frugal, apt for all affairs,                          <br>
And in his shepherd's calling he was prompt<br>
And watchful more than ordinary men.<br>
Hence had he learned the meaning of all winds,<br>
Of blasts of every tone; and, oftentimes,<br>
When others heeded not, He heard the South                         <br>
Make subterraneous music, like the noise<br>
Of bagpipers on distant Highland hills.<br>
The Shepherd, at such warning, of his flock<br>
Bethought him, and he to himself would say,<br>
"The winds are now devising work for me!"                          <br>
And, truly, at all times, the storm, that drives<br>
The traveller to a shelter, summoned him<br>
Up to the mountains: he had been alone<br>
Amid the heart of many thousand mists,<br>
That came to him, and left him, on the heights.                    <br>
So lived he till his eightieth year was past.<br>
And grossly that man errs, who should suppose<br>
That the green valleys, and the streams and rocks,<br>
Were things indifferent to the Shepherd's thoughts.<br>
Fields, where with cheerful spirits he had breathed                <br>
The common air; hills, which with vigorous step<br>
He had so often climbed; which had impressed<br>
So many incidents upon his mind<br>
Of hardship, skill or courage, joy or fear;<br>
Which, like a book, preserved the memory                           <br>
Of the dumb animals, whom he had saved,<br>
Had fed or sheltered, linking to such acts<br>
The certainty of honourable gain;<br>
Those fields, those hills&mdash;what could they less? had laid<br>
Strong hold on his affections, were to him                         <br>
A pleasurable feeling of blind love,<br>
The pleasure which there is in life itself.<br><br>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  His days had not been passed in singleness.<br>
His Helpmate was a comely matron, old&mdash;<br>
Though younger than himself full twenty years.                     <br>
She was a woman of a stirring life,<br>
Whose heart was in her house: two wheels she had<br>
Of antique form; this large, for spinning wool;<br>
That small, for flax; and if one wheel had rest,<br>
It was because the other was at work.                              <br>
The Pair had but one inmate in their house,<br>
An only Child, who had been born to them<br>
When Michael, telling o'er his years, began<br>
To deem that he was old,&mdash;in shepherd's phrase,<br>
With one foot in the grave. This only Son,                         <br>
With two brave sheep-dogs tried in many a storm,<br>
The one of an inestimable worth,<br>
Made all their household. I may truly say,<br>
That they were as a proverb in the vale<br>
For endless industry. When day was gone,                           <br>
And from their occupations out of doors<br>
The Son and Father were come home, even then,<br>
Their labour did not cease; unless when all<br>
Turned to the cleanly supper-board, and there,<br>
Each with a mess of pottage and skimmed milk,                     <br>
Sat round the basket piled with oaten cakes,<br>
And their plain home-made cheese. Yet when the meal<br>
Was ended, Luke (for so the Son was named)<br>
And his old Father both betook themselves<br>
To such convenient work as might employ                           <br>
Their hands by the fire-side; perhaps to card<br>
Wool for the Housewife's spindle, or repair<br>
Some injury done to sickle, flail, or scythe,<br>
Or other implement of house or field.<br><br>

Down from the ceiling, by the chimney's edge,                     <br>
That in our ancient uncouth country style<br>
With huge and black projection overbrowed<br>
Large space beneath, as duly as the light<br>
Of day grew dim the Housewife hung a lamp;<br>
An aged utensil, which had performed                              <br>
Service beyond all others of its kind.<br>
Early at evening did it burn&mdash;and late,<br>
Surviving comrade of uncounted hours,<br>
Which, going by from year to year, had found,<br>
And left the couple neither gay perhaps                           <br>
Nor cheerful, yet with objects and with hopes,<br>
Living a life of eager industry.<br>
And now, when Luke had reached his eighteenth year,<br>
There by the light of this old lamp they sate,<br>
Father and Son, while far into the night                     <br>
The Housewife plied her own peculiar work,<br>
Making the cottage through the silent hours<br>
Murmur as with the sound of summer flies.<br>
This light was famous in its neighbourhood,<br>
And was a public symbol of the life                               <br>
That thrifty Pair had lived. For, as it chanced,<br>
Their cottage on a plot of rising ground<br>
Stood single, with large prospect, north and south,<br>
High into Easedale, up to Dunmail-Raise,<br>
And westward to the village near the lake;                        <br>
And from this constant light, so regular<br>
And so far seen, the House itself, by all<br>
Who dwelt within the limits of the vale,<br>
Both old and young, was named <b>The Evening Star</b>.<br><br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus living on through such a length of years,                  <br>
The Shepherd, if he loved himself, must needs<br>
Have loved his Helpmate; but to Michael's heart<br>
This son of his old age was yet more dear&mdash;<br>
Less from instinctive tenderness, the same<br>
Fond spirit that blindly works in the blood of all&mdash;         <br>
Than that a child, more than all other gifts<br>
That earth can offer to declining man,<br>
Brings hope with it, and forward-looking thoughts,<br>
And stirrings of inquietude, when they<br>
By tendency of nature needs must fail.                            <br>
Exceeding was the love he bare to him,<br>
His heart and his heart's joy! For oftentimes<br>
Old Michael, while he was a babe in arms,<br>
Had done him female service, not alone<br>
For pastime and delight, as is the use                       <br>
Of fathers, but with patient mind enforced<br>
To acts of tenderness; and he had rocked<br>
His cradle, as with a woman's gentle hand.<br>
And, in a later time, ere yet the Boy<br>
Had put on boy's attire, did Michael love,                        <br>
Albeit of a stern unbending mind,<br>
To have the Young-one in his sight, when he<br>
Wrought in the field, or on his shepherd's stool<br>
Sate with a fettered sheep before him stretched<br>
Under the large old oak, that near his door                       <br>
Stood single, and, from matchless depth of shade,<br>
Chosen for the Shearer's covert from the sun,<br>
Thence in our rustic dialect was called<br>
The <b>Clipping Tree</b>, a name which yet it bears.<br>
There, while they two were sitting in the shade,                  <br>
With others round them, earnest all and blithe,<br>
Would Michael exercise his heart with looks<br>
Of fond correction and reproof bestowed<br>
Upon the Child, if he disturbed the sheep<br>
By catching at their legs, or with his shouts                     <br>
Scared them, while they lay still beneath the shears.<br><br>

And when by Heaven's good grace the boy grew up<br>
A healthy Lad, and carried in his cheek<br>
Two steady roses that were five years old;<br>
Then Michael from a winter coppice cut                            <br>
With his own hand a sapling, which he hooped<br>
With iron, making it throughout in all<br>
Due requisites a perfect shepherd's staff,<br>
And gave it to the Boy; wherewith equipt<br>
He as a watchman oftentimes was placed                            <br>
At gate or gap, to stem or turn the flock;<br>
And, to his office prematurely called,<br>
There stood the urchin, as you will divine,<br>
Something between a hindrance and a help;<br>
And for this cause not always, I believe,                         <br>
Receiving from his Father hire of praise;<br>
Though nought was left undone which staff, or voice,<br>
Or looks, or threatening gestures, could perform.<br><br>

But soon as Luke, full ten years old, could stand<br>
Against the mountain blasts; and to the heights,                  <br>
Not fearing toil, nor length of weary ways,<br>
He with his Father daily went, and they<br>
Were as companions, why should I relate<br>
That objects which the Shepherd loved before<br>
Were dearer now? that from the Boy there came                     <br>
Feelings and emanations&mdash;things which were<br>
Light to the sun and music to the wind;<br>
And that the old Man's heart seemed born again?<br><br>

Thus in his Father's sight the Boy grew up:<br>
And now, when he had reached his eighteenth year,                 <br>
He was his comfort and his daily hope.<br><br>

While in this sort the simple household lived<br>
From day to day, to Michael's ear there came<br>
Distressful tidings. Long before the time<br>
Of which I speak, the Shepherd had been bound                     <br>
In surety for his brother's son, a man<br>
Of an industrious life, and ample means;<br>
But unforeseen misfortunes suddenly<br>
Had prest upon him; and old Michael now<br>
Was summoned to discharge the forfeiture,                         <br>
A grievous penalty, but little less<br>
Than half his substance. This unlooked-for claim,<br>
At the first hearing, for a moment took<br>
More hope out of his life than he supposed<br>
That any old man ever could have lost.                            <br>
As soon as he had armed himself with strength<br>
To look his trouble in the face, it seemed<br>
The Shepherd's sole resource to sell at once<br>
A portion of his patrimonial fields.<br>
Such was his first resolve; he thought again,                     <br>
And his heart failed him. "Isabel," said he,<br>
Two evenings after he had heard the news,<br>
"I have been toiling more than seventy years,<br>
And in the open sunshine of God's love<br>
Have we all lived; yet if these fields of ours                    <br>
Should pass into a stranger's hand, I think<br>
That I could not lie quiet in my grave.<br>
Our lot is a hard lot; the sun himself<br>
Has scarcely been more diligent than I;<br>
And I have lived to be a fool at last                             <br>
To my own family. An evil man<br>
That was, and made an evil choice, if he<br>
Were false to us; and if he were not false,<br>
There are ten thousand to whom loss like this<br>
Had been no sorrow. I forgive him;&mdash;but                           <br>
'Twere better to be dumb than to talk thus.<br><br>

"When I began, my purpose was to speak<br>
Of remedies and of a cheerful hope.<br>
Our Luke shall leave us, Isabel; the land<br>
Shall not go from us, and it shall be free;                       <br>
He shall possess it, free as is the wind<br>
That passes over it. We have, thou know'st,<br>
Another kinsman&mdash;he will be our friend<br>
In this distress. He is a prosperous man,<br>
Thriving in trade&mdash;and Luke to him shall go,                      <br>
And with his kinsman's help and his own thrift<br>
He quickly will repair this loss, and then<br>
He may return to us. If here he stay,<br>
What can be done? Where every one is poor,<br>
What can be gained?"                                              <br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;               At this the old Man paused,<br>
And Isabel sat silent, for her mind<br>
Was busy, looking back into past times.<br>
There's Richard Bateman, thought she to herself,<br>
He was a parish-boy&mdash;at the church-door                           <br>
They made a gathering for him, shillings, pence<br>
And halfpennies, wherewith the neighbours bought<br>
A basket, which they filled with pedlar's wares;<br>
And, with this basket on his arm, the lad<br>
Went up to London, found a master there,                          <br>
Who, out of many, chose the trusty boy<br>
To go and overlook his merchandise<br>
Beyond the seas; where he grew wondrous rich,<br>
And left estates and monies to the poor,<br>
And, at his birth-place, built a chapel floored                   <br>
With marble, which he sent from foreign lands.<br>
These thoughts, and many others of like sort,<br>
Passed quickly through the mind of Isabel,<br>
And her face brightened. The old Man was glad,<br>
And thus resumed:&mdash;"Well, Isabel! this scheme                     <br>
These two days, has been meat and drink to me.<br>
Far more than we have lost is left us yet.<br>
&mdash;We have enough&mdash;I wish indeed that I<br>
Were younger;&mdash;but this hope is a good hope.<br>
Make ready Luke's best garments, of the best                      <br>
Buy for him more, and let us send him forth <br>
To-morrow, or the next day, or to-night:<br>
&mdash;If he <i>could</i> go, the Boy should go to-night."<br><br>

Here Michael ceased, and to the fields went forth<br>
With a light heart. The Housewife for five days               <br>
Was restless morn and night, and all day long<br>
Wrought on with her best fingers to prepare<br>
Things needful for the journey of her son.<br>
But Isabel was glad when Sunday came<br>
To stop her in her work: for, when she lay                        <br>
By Michael's side, she through the last two nights<br>
Heard him, how he was troubled in his sleep:<br>
And when they rose at morning she could see<br>
That all his hopes were gone. That day at noon<br>
She said to Luke, while they two by themselves                    <br>
Were sitting at the door, "Thou must not go:<br>
We have no other Child but thee to lose,<br>
None to remember&mdash;do not go away,<br>
For if thou leave thy Father he will die."<br>
The Youth made answer with a jocund voice;                   <br>
And Isabel, when she had told her fears,<br>
Recovered heart. That evening her best fare<br>
Did she bring forth, and all together sat<br>
Like happy people round a Christmas fire.<br><br>

With daylight Isabel resumed her work;                       <br>
And all the ensuing week the house appeared<br>
As cheerful as a grove in Spring: at length<br>
The expected letter from their kinsman came,<br>
With kind assurances that he would do<br>
His utmost for the welfare of the Boy;                            <br>
To which, requests were added, that forthwith<br>
He might be sent to him. Ten times or more<br>
The letter was read over; Isabel<br>
Went forth to show it to the neighbours round;<br>
Nor was there at that time on English land                        <br>
A prouder heart than Luke's. When Isabel<br>
Had to her house returned, the old Man said,<br>
"He shall depart to-morrow." To this word<br>
The Housewife answered, talking much of things<br>
Which, if at such short notice he should go,                      <br>
Would surely be forgotten. But at length<br>
She gave consent, and Michael was at ease.<br><br>

Near the tumultuous brook of Green-head Ghyll,<br>
In that deep valley, Michael had designed<br>
To build a Sheep-fold; and, before he heard                   <br>
The tidings of his melancholy loss,<br>
For this same purpose he had gathered up<br>
A heap of stones, which by the streamlet's edge<br>
Lay thrown together, ready for the work.<br>
With Luke that evening thitherward he walked:                     <br>
And soon as they had reached the place he stopped,<br>
And thus the old Man spake to him:&mdash;"My Son,<br>
To-morrow thou wilt leave me: with full heart<br>
I look upon thee, for thou art the same<br>
That wert a promise to me ere thy birth,                          <br>
And all thy life hast been my daily joy.<br>
I will relate to thee some little part<br>
Of our two histories; 'twill do thee good<br>
When thou art from me, even if I should touch<br>
On things thou canst not know of.&mdash;After thou                <br>
First cam'st into the world&mdash;as oft befals<br>
To new-born infants&mdash;thou didst sleep away<br>
Two days, and blessings from thy Father's tongue<br>
Then fell upon thee. Day by day passed on,<br>
And still I loved thee with increasing love.                      <br>
Never to living ear came sweeter sounds<br>
Than when I heard thee by our own fire-side<br>
First uttering, without words, a natural tune;<br>
While thou, a feeding babe, didst in thy joy<br>
Sing at thy Mother's breast. Month followed month,                <br>
And in the open fields my life was passed<br>
And on the mountains; else I think that thou<br>
Hadst been brought up upon thy Father's knees.<br>
But we were playmates, Luke: among these hills,<br>
As well thou knowest, in us the old and young                     <br>
Have played together, nor with me didst thou<br>
Lack any pleasure which a boy can know."<br>
Luke had a manly heart; but at these words<br>
He sobbed aloud. The old Man grasped his hand,<br>
And said, "Nay, do not take it so&mdash;I see                          <br>
That these are things of which I need not speak.<br>
&mdash;Even to the utmost I have been to thee<br>
A kind and a good Father: and herein<br>
I but repay a gift which I myself<br>
Received at others' hands; for, though now old                    <br>
Beyond the common life of man, I still<br>
Remember them who loved me in my youth.<br>
Both of them sleep together: here they lived,<br>
As all their Forefathers had done; and when<br>
At length their time was come, they were not loth                 <br>
To give their bodies to the family mould.<br>
I wished that thou should'st live the life they lived:<br>
But, 'tis a long time to look back, my Son,<br>
And see so little gain from threescore years.<br>
These fields were burthened when they came to me;                 <br>
Till I was forty years of age, not more<br>
Than half of my inheritance was mine.<br>
I toiled and toiled; God blessed me in my work,<br>
And till these three weeks past the land was free.<br>
&mdash;It looks as if it never could endure                            <br>
Another Master. Heaven forgive me, Luke,<br>
If I judge ill for thee, but it seems good<br>
That thou should'st go,"<br><br>

At this the old Man paused;<br>
Then, pointing to the stones near which they stood,               <br>
Thus, after a short silence, he resumed:<br>
"This was a work for us; and now, my Son,<br>
It is a work for me. But, lay one stone&mdash;<br>
Here, lay it for me, Luke, with thine own hands.<br>
Nay, Boy, be of good hope;&mdash;we both may live                 <br>
To see a better day. At eighty-four<br>
I still am strong and hale;&mdash;do thou thy part;<br>
I will do mine.&mdash;I will begin again<br>
With many tasks that were resigned to thee:<br>
Up to the heights, and in among the storms,                       <br>
Will I without thee go again, and do<br>
All works which I was wont to do alone,<br>
Before I knew thy face.&mdash;Heaven bless thee, Boy!<br>
Thy heart these two weeks has been beating fast<br>
With many hopes; it should be so&mdash;yes&mdash;yes&mdash;                      <br>
I knew that thou could'st never have a wish<br>
To leave me, Luke: thou hast been bound to me<br>
Only by links of love: when thou art gone,<br>
What will be left to us!&mdash;But, I forget<br>
My purposes. Lay now the corner-stone,                            <br>
As I requested; and hereafter, Luke,<br>
When thou art gone away, should evil men<br>
Be thy companions, think of me, my Son,<br>
And of this moment; hither turn thy thoughts,<br>
And God will strengthen thee: amid all fear                       <br>
And all temptation, Luke, I pray that thou<br>
May'st bear in mind the life thy Fathers lived,<br>
Who, being innocent, did for that cause<br>
Bestir them in good deeds. Now, fare thee well&mdash;<br>
When thou return'st, thou in this place wilt see                  <br>
A work which is not here: a covenant<br>
'Twill be between us; but, whatever fate<br>
Befal thee, I shall love thee to the last,<br>
And bear thy memory with me to the grave."<br><br>

The Shepherd ended here; and Luke stooped down,                   <br>
And, as his Father had requested, laid<br>
The first stone of the Sheep-fold. At the sight<br>
The old Man's grief broke from him; to his heart<br>
He pressed his Son, he kiss&egrave;d him and wept;<br>
And to the house together they returned.                          <br>
&mdash;Hushed was that House in peace, or seeming peace,<br>
Ere the night fell:&mdash;with morrow's dawn the Boy<br>
Began his journey, and when he had reached<br>
The public way, he put on a bold face;<br>
And all the neighbours, as he passed their doors,                 <br>
Came forth with wishes and with farewell prayers,<br>
That followed him till he was out of sight.<br><br>

A good report did from their Kinsman come,<br>
Of Luke and his well doing: and the Boy<br>
Wrote loving letters, full of wondrous news,                      <br>
Which, as the Housewife phrased it, were throughout<br>
"The prettiest letters that were ever seen."<br>
Both parents read them with rejoicing hearts.<br>
So, many months passed on: and once again<br>
The Shepherd went about his daily work                            <br>
With confident and cheerful thoughts; and now<br>
Sometimes when he could find a leisure hour<br>
He to that valley took his way, and there<br>
Wrought at the Sheep-fold. Meantime Luke began<br>
To slacken in his duty; and, at length,                           <br>
He in the dissolute city gave himself<br>
To evil courses: ignominy and shame<br>
Fell on him, so that he was driven at last<br>
To seek a hiding-place beyond the seas.<br><br>

There is a comfort in the strength of love;                       <br>
'Twill make a thing endurable, which else<br>
Would overset the brain, or break the heart:<br>
I have conversed with more than one who well<br>
Remember the old Man, and what he was<br>
Years after he had heard this heavy news.                         <br>
His bodily frame had been from youth to age<br>
Of an unusual strength. Among the rocks<br>
He went, and still looked up to sun and cloud,<br>
And listened to the wind; and, as before,<br>
Performed all kinds of labour for his sheep,                      <br>
And for the land, his small inheritance.<br>
And to that hollow dell from time to time<br>
Did he repair, to build the Fold of which<br>
His flock had need. 'Tis not forgotten yet<br>
The pity which was then in every heart                            <br>
For the old Man&mdash;and 'tis believed by all<br>
That many and many a day he thither went,<br>
And never lifted up a single stone.<br><br>

There, by the Sheep-fold, sometimes was he seen<br>
Sitting alone, or with his faithful Dog,                     <br>
Then old, beside him, lying at his feet.<br>
The length of full seven years, from time to time,<br>
He at the building of this Sheep-fold wrought,<br>
And left the work unfinished when he died.<br>
Three years, or little more, did Isabel                           <br>
Survive her Husband: at her death the estate<br>
Was sold, and went into a stranger's hand.<br>
The Cottage which was named the <b>Evening Star</b><br>
Is gone&mdash;the ploughshare has been through the ground<br>
On which it stood; great changes have been wrought                <br>
In all the neighbourhood:&mdash;yet the oak is left<br>
That grew beside their door; and the remains<br>
Of the unfinished Sheep-fold may be seen<br>
Beside the boisterous brook of Green-head Ghyll.<br>

  1650 by Roland Wilson, producing at present &pound;12 per annum. The average
  number of boys is twenty-five. This endowment was augmented by &pound;8 per
  annum by Robert Bateman, who gave &pound;1000 for purchasing an estate, and
  erected eight alms-houses for as many poor families, besides a
  donation of &pound;12 per annum to the curate. This worthy benefactor was

different divisions. It is generally placed by the side of a brook, for

for them, and as a place to drive them into, to enable the shepherds

<a name="50n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">From the Fenwick note it will be seen that Michael's sheep-fold, in
Green-head Ghyll, existed&mdash;at least the remains of it&mdash; in 1843. Its
site, however, is now very difficult to identify. There is a sheep-fold
above Boon Beck, which one passes immediately on entering the common,
going up Green-head Ghyll. It is now "finished," and used when required.
There are remains of walling, much higher up the ghyll; but these are
probably the work of miners, formerly engaged there. Michael's cottage
had been destroyed when the poem was written, in 1800. It stood where
the coach-house and stables of "the Hollins" now stand. But one who
visits Green-head Ghyll, and wishes to realize Michael in his old
age&mdash;as described in this poem&mdash;should ascend the ghyll till it almost
reaches the top of Fairfield; where the old man, during eighty years,</span>

<blockquote>'had learned the meaning of all winds,<br>
  Of blasts of every tone,'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">and where he</span>

<blockquote>'had been alone,<br>
  Amid the heart of many thousand mists,<br>
  That came to him, and left him, on the heights.'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">By so doing he will be better able to realize the spirit of the poem,
than by trying to identify the site either of the "unfinished
sheep-fold," or of the house named the "Evening Star." What Wordsworth
said to the Hon. Mr. Justice Coleridge in reference to <i>The Brothers</i>
has been quoted in the note to that poem, p. 203. On the same occasion
he remarked, in reference to <i>Michael:&mdash;</i></span>

<blockquote>"<i>Michael</i> was founded on the
son of an old couple having become dissolute, and run away from his
parents; and on an old shepherd having been seven years in building up a
sheep-fold in a solitary valley."</blockquote> 

<span style="color: #555555;">(<i>Memoirs of Wordsworth</i>, by the late
Bishop of Lincoln, vol. ii. p. 305.)<br>
<br>
The following extracts from Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Grasmere Journal,</i> show
the carefulness with which the poem <i>Michael</i> was composed, and the
frequent revisions which it underwent:&mdash;</span>

<blockquote>  Oct. 11 [1800.] "We walked up Green-head ghyll in search of a
  sheepfold.... The sheepfold is falling away. It is built nearly in the
  form of a heart unequally divided."<br>
<br>
  13. "William composing in the evening."<br>
<br>
  15. "W. composed a little." ... "W. again composed at the sheepfold
  after dinner."<br>
<br>
  18. "W. worked all the morning at the sheepfold, but in vain. He lay
  down till 7 o'clock, but did not sleep."<br>
<br>
  19. "William got to work."<br>
<br>
  20. "W. worked in the morning at the sheepfold."<br>
<br>
  21. "W. had been unsuccessful in the morning at the sheepfold."<br>
<br>
  22. "W. composed, without much success, at the sheepfold."<br>
<br>
  23. "W. was not successful in composition in the evening."<br>
<br>
  24. "W. was only partly successful in composition."<br>
<br>
  26. "W. composed a good deal all the morning."<br>
<br>
  28. "W. could not compose much; fatigued himself with altering."<br>
<br>
  30. "W. worked at his poem all the morning."<br>
<br>
  Nov. 10. "W. at the sheepfold."<br>
<br>
  12. "W. has been working at the sheepfold."<br>
<br>
  Dec. 9. "W. finished his poem to-day."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">It is impossible to say with certainty that the entry under Dec. 9
refers to <i>Michael</i>, but if it does, it is evident that Wordsworth
wrought continuously at this poem for nearly two months.<br>
<br>
On April 9, 1801, Wordsworth wrote to Thomas Poole:</span>

<blockquote>  "In writing it" (<i>Michael</i>), "I had your character often before
  my eyes; and sometimes thought that I was delineating such a man as
  you yourself would have been, under the same circumstances."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The following is part of a letter written by Wordsworth to Charles James
Fox in 1802, and sent with a copy of "Lyrical Ballads":</span>

<blockquote>  "In the two poems, <i>The Brothers</i> and <i>Michael</i>, I have
  attempted to draw a picture of the domestic affections, as I know they
  exist amongst a class of men who are now almost confined to the north
  of England. They are small independent <i>proprietors</i> of land,
  here called 'statesmen,' men of respectable education, who daily
  labour on their own little properties. The domestic affections will
  always be strong amongst men who live in a country not crowded with
  population; if these men are placed above poverty. But, if they are
  proprietors of small estates which have descended to them from their
  ancestors, the power which these affections will acquire amongst such
  men, is inconceivable by those who have only had an opportunity of
  observing hired labourers, farmers, and the manufacturing poor. Their
  little tract of land serves as a kind of permanent rallying point for
  their domestic feelings, as a tablet on which they are written, which
  makes them objects of memory in a thousand instances, when they would
  otherwise be forgotten. It is a fountain fitted to the nature of
  social man, from which supplies of affection as pure as his heart was
  intended for, are daily drawn. This class of men is rapidly
  disappearing.... The two poems that I have mentioned were written with
  a view to show that men who do not wear fine clothes can feel deeply.
  <i>Pectus enim est quod disertos facit, et vis mentis. Ideoque imperitis
  quoque, si modo sint aliquo affectu concitati, verba non desunt.</i> The
  poems are faithful copies from nature; and I hope whatever effect they
  may have upon you, you will at least be able to perceive that they may
  excite profitable sympathies in many kind and good hearts; and may in
  some small degree enlarge our feelings of reverence for our species,
  and our knowledge of human nature, by showing that our best qualities
  are possessed by men whom we are too apt to consider, not with
  reference to the points in which they resemble us, but to those in
  which they manifestly differ from us."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">A number of fragments, originally meant to be parts of
<i>Michael</i>,&mdash;or at least written with such a possibility in view,&mdash;
will be found in the Appendix to the eighth volume of this edition.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>
